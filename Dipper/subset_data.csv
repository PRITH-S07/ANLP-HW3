base,llama-3,"1 INTRODUCTION
The introduction provides a clear overview of the paper's main theme, which is the study of universality in optimization algorithms. The authors introduce the concept of halting time, which is the time it takes for an optimization algorithm to stop, and discuss how it can be used to analyze the performance of different algorithms. The introduction also provides a brief overview of the different algorithms that will be studied in the paper, including conjugate gradient, gradient descent, and stochastic gradient descent.

Strengths: The introduction is clear and concise, and it provides a good overview of the paper's main theme. The authors do a good job of introducing the concept of halting time and explaining its importance in the context of optimization algorithms.

Weaknesses: The introduction could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the concept of universality and how it relates to the halting time. Additionally, the authors could provide more context about the different algorithms that will be studied in the paper, including their applications and limitations.

1.1 DEFINITION OF UNIVERSALITY

human,human,"This paper proposes a simple but effective extension to reinforcement learning algorithms, by adding a temporal repetition component as part of the action space, enabling the policy to select how long to repeat the chosen action for. The extension applies to all reinforcement learning algorithms, including both discrete and continuous domains, as it is primarily changing the action parametrization. The paper is well-written, and the experiments extensively evaluate the approach with 3 different RL algorithms in 3 different domains (Atari, MuJoCo, and TORCS).

Here are some comments and questions, for improving the paper:

The introduction states that ""all DRL algorithms repeatedly execute a chosen action for a fixed number of time steps k"". This statement is too strong, and is actually disproved in the experiments — repeating an action is helpful in many tasks, but not in all tasks. The sentence should be rephrased to be more precise.

In the related work, a discussion of the relation to semi-MDPs would be useful to help the reader better understand the approach and how it compares and differs (e.g. the response from the pre-review questions)

Experiments:
Can you provide error bars on the experimental results? (from running multiple random seeds)

It would be useful to see experiments with parameter sharing in the TRPO experiments, to be more consistent with the other domains, especially since it seems that the improvement in the TRPO experiments is smaller than that of the other two domains. Right now, it is hard to tell if the smaller improvement is because of the nature of the task, because of the lack of parameter sharing, or something else.

The TRPO evaluation is different from the results reported in Duan et al. ICML ’16. Why not use the same benchmark?

Videos only show the policies learned with FiGAR, which are uninformative without also seeing the policies learned without FiGAR. Can you also include videos of the policies learned without FiGAR, as a comparison point?

How many laps does DDPG complete without FiGAR? The difference in reward achieved seems quite substantial (557K vs. 59K).

Can the tables be visualized as histograms? This seems like it would more effectively and efficiently communicate the results.

Minor comments:
-- On the plot in Figure 2, the label for the first bar should be changed from 1000 to 3500.
-- “idea of deciding when necessary” - seems like it would be better to say “idea of only deciding when necessary""
-- ""spaces.Durugkar et al.” — missing a space.
-- “R={4}” — why 4? Could you use a letter to indicate a constant instead? (or a different notation)

human,human,"Dear Reviewers,

We have upload a revised paper. Here is a list of summary for our revision.

1) We added a performance comparison of uniform quantization with non-weighed mean and uniform quantization with Hessian-weighted mean in Appendix A.3 in the revised paper. We also added a sentence for this in lines 2-4 of the last paragraph of Section 5.3 in the revised paper.

2) We revised the second paragraph of Section 4.5 in the original paper and clarified it as follows:

""We note that quantization of all layers is proposed under the assumption that all of binary encoded quantized parameters in a network are simply stored in one single array. Under this assumption, if layer-by-layer quantization is employed, then we need to assign some (additional) bits to each binary codeword for layer information (layer index), and it hurts the compression ratio. If we quantize all parameters of a network together, then we can avoid such additional overhead for layer indication when storing binary encoded quantized parameters. Thus, in this case, quantizing all layers together is beneficial and Hessian-weighting can be used to address the different impact of the quantization errors across layers.

For layer-by-layer quantization, it is advantageous to use separate arrays and separate lookup tables for different layers since layer information can be excluded in each of binary codewords for network parameters. Hessian-weighting can still provide gain even in this case for layer-by-layer quantization since it can address the different impact of the quantization errors of network parameters within each layer as well.""

3) We added the following sentence in the abstract as your suggestion (see Abstract lines 12-15 in the revised paper).

""Hessian-weighting properly handles the different impact of quantization errors not only within layers but also across layers and thus it can be employed for quantizing all layers of a network together at once; it is beneficial since one can avoid layer-by-layer compression rate optimization.""

We also added the following sentence in Section 7 as your suggestion (see Section 7 lines 8-11 in the revised paper).

""Hessian-weighting is beneficial in quantizing all of the network parameters together at once since it can handle the different impact of quantization errors properly not only within layers but also across layers; thus, using Hessian-weighting, we can avoid layer-by-layer compression rate optimization.""

4) We reduced the number of pages from 17 to 15 (excluding reference and appendices).

- We removed the third paragraph in page 2 of the original paper.
- We removed the last two sentences in the first paragraph of Section 2 of the original paper.
- We removed the last three sentences in the first paragraph of Section 3 of the original paper.
- We removed the last three sentences in the first paragraph of Section 4 of the original paper.
- We removed the second to the fifth paragraphs in Section 5 of the original paper.
- We revised the paragraphs right before Section 6.1 and Section 6.1 as well in order to remove any duplications.
- We moved the second table in Table 1 of the original paper to Appendix A.4 in the revised paper since it is extra information.

5) We added the following sentence at the end of Section 4.1 of the revised paper for clarification.

""We note that we do not consider the interactions between retraining and quantization in our formulation. In this paper, we analyze the expected loss due to quantization of all network parameters assuming no further retraining and focus on finding optimal network quantization schemes that minimize the performance loss while maximizing the compression ratio. After quantization, however, in our experiments, we fine-tune the quantized values (cluster centers) so that we can recover the loss due to quantization and improve the performance further.""

Thank you again for your comments and suggestions. We look forward to further comments.

#### Title: SampleRNN: An Unconditional End-to-End Neural Network for Raw Audio Waveform Synthesis

#### Summary
The paper introduces SampleRNN, a novel approach for audio waveform synthesis using a hierarchical recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. The model operates at multiple temporal resolutions, allowing it to efficiently capture dependencies at different scales in audio data. The authors claim that this approach is more flexible and efficient than traditional methods that rely on hand-engineered features and complex signal processing pipelines.

#### Strengths

2. **End-to-End Learning**: The model is trained end-to-end, which simplifies the pipeline by eliminating the need for handcrafted feature extraction. This is a substantial improvement over traditional methods that require extensive domain expertise.

3. **Flexibility**: The ability to allocate computational resources differently across modules allows the model to focus on capturing long-term dependencies without being bogged down by the high dimensionality of raw audio signals.

4. **Empirical Evaluation**: The paper provides empirical results on three audio datasets, including human evaluations, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.

5. **Code Availability**: The authors have made the code publicly available, which is a great asset for reproducibility and further research.

human,human,"The authors propose the use of a vertical and horizontal one-dimensional RNN (denoted as L-RNN module) to capture long-range dependencies and summarize convolutional feature maps. L-RNN modules are an alternative to deeper or wider networks, 2D RNNs, dilated (Atrous) convolutional layers, and a simple flatten or global pooling layer when applied to the last convolutional layer for classification. L-RNN modules are faster than 2D RNNs, since rows and columns can be processed in parallel, are easy to implemented, and can be inserted in existing convolutional networks. The authors demonstrate improvements for classification and semantic segmentation.

However, further evaluations are required that show for which use cases L-RNNs are superior to alternatives for summarizing convolutional feature maps:

1. I suggest to use a fixed CNN with as certain number of layers, and summarize the last feature map by a) a flatten layer, b) global average pooling, c) a 2D RNN, d) and dilated convolutional layers for segmentation. The authors should report both the run-time and number of parameters for these variants in addition to prediction performances. For segmentation, the number of dilated convolutional layers should be chosen such that the number of parameters is similar to a single L-RNN module.

2. The authors compare classification performances only on 32x32 CIFAR-10 images. For higher resolution images, the benefit of L-RNN modules to capture long-range dependencies might be more pronounced. I therefore suggest evaluating classification performances on one additional dataset with higher resolution images, e.g. ImageNet or the CUB bird dataset.

Additionally, I have the following minor comments:

3. The authors use vanilla RNNs. It might be worth investigating LSTMs or GRUs instead.

4. For classification, the authors summarize hidden states of the final vertical recurrent layer by global max pooling. Is this different from more common global average pooling or concatenating the final forward and backward recurrent states?

5. Table 3 is hard to understand since it mingles datasets (Pascal P and COCO C) and methods (CRF post-processing). I suggest, e.g., using an additional column with CRF ‘yes’ or ‘no’. I further suggest listing the number of parameters and runtime if possible.

6. Section 3 does not clearly describe in which order batch-normalization is applied in residual blocks. Figure 2 suggest that the newer BN-ReLU-Conv order described in He et al. (2016) is used. This should be mentioned in the text.

Finally, the text needs to be revised to reach publication level quality. Specifically, I have the following comments:

7. Equation (1) is the update of a vanilla RNN, which should be stated more clearly. I suggest to first describe (bidirectional) RNNs, to reference GRUs and LSTMs, and then describe how they are applied here to images. Figure 1 should also be referenced in the text.

8. In section 2.2, I suggest to describe Bell at al. more clearly. Why are they using eight instead of four RNNs? 

9. Section 4 starts with a verbose description about transfer learning, which can be compressed into a single reference or skipped entirely.

10. Equation (6) seems to be missing an index i.

11.In particular section 5 and 6 contain a lot of clutter and slang, which should be avoided:
11.1 page 8: ‘As can be seen’, ‘we turn to that case next’
11.2 page 9: ‘to the very high value’, ‘as noted earlier’,  ‘less context to contribute here’
11.3 page 10: ‘In fact’, ‘far deeper’, ‘a simple matter of’, ‘there is much left to investigate.

**Review:**

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Concept:** The paper introduces a novel concept called ""Information Dropout,"" which aims to improve the generalization performance of neural networks by selectively introducing multiplicative noise in the layer activations. This approach is grounded in the Information Bottleneck principle, providing a theoretical framework for understanding and improving dropout methods.

2. **Theoretical Foundation:** The authors provide a strong theoretical basis for their method by linking it to the Information Bottleneck principle. This connection offers a new perspective on how neural networks can be trained to focus on task-relevant information while discarding nuisance factors.

3. **Unified Framework:** The paper successfully positions Information Dropout as a generalization of existing dropout methods, such as binary dropout and Variational Dropout. This unification offers a comprehensive framework for analyzing and understanding various dropout techniques.

4. **Practical Implications:** The proposed method is shown to improve generalization performance, particularly in smaller models where traditional dropout methods may struggle. The adaptability of the noise to the network structure and individual samples is a notable advantage.

5. **Empirical Validation:** The paper includes experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of Information Dropout in improving generalization performance compared to baseline dropout methods.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Accessibility:** The paper is dense with theoretical concepts, which may be challenging for readers who are not familiar with information theory or the Information Bottleneck principle. The explanations could be made more accessible to a broader audience.

2. **Experimental Details:** While the paper mentions various experiments, it lacks detailed descriptions of the experimental setup, datasets used, and specific metrics for evaluation. Providing more comprehensive experimental details would strengthen the empirical claims.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** Although the paper claims improvements over existing methods, a more thorough comparative analysis with a wider range of baseline methods would provide a clearer picture of the advantages and limitations of Information Dropout.

4. **Scalability and Complexity:** The paper does not address the computational complexity or scalability of the proposed method. It would be beneficial to discuss how Information Dropout performs in large-scale settings and its impact on training time and resource requirements.

1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper presents a novel hybrid methodology that combines the strengths of traditional variational inference with modern inference networks. This approach addresses the initialization problem in deep latent Gaussian models (DLGMs) by optimizing local variational parameters, which is particularly beneficial for modeling high-dimensional sparse data.

2. **Interpretability Contribution:** The introduction of a method to interpret deep generative models using Jacobian vectors is a significant contribution. This addresses a common criticism of deep models regarding their lack of interpretability, potentially making them more accessible and useful for practitioners who require insights into the model's learning process.

3. **Theoretical Foundation:** The paper is well-grounded in existing literature, referencing key works in the field such as those by Kingma et al. and Rezende et al. It builds on these foundations to propose enhancements that are both theoretically sound and practically relevant.

4. **Practical Relevance:** The use of tf-idf features to incorporate global information into the inference process is a practical and effective strategy for dealing with sparse data, which is a common challenge in many real-world applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Empirical Results:** The paper does not provide empirical results or experiments to validate the proposed methods. Without quantitative evidence, it is difficult to assess the practical impact and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid inference approach and interpretability technique.

2. **Complexity and Scalability:** While the paper discusses the benefits of optimizing local variational parameters, it does not address the potential computational overhead introduced by this additional optimization step. The scalability of the approach for very large datasets is not discussed.

3. **Clarity and Structure:** The paper could benefit from clearer explanations and a more structured presentation. Some sections, particularly the methodology, are dense and may be difficult for readers to follow without a strong background in variational inference and deep generative models.

4. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** The paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations or potential drawbacks of the proposed methods. For instance, the reliance on tf-idf might not be suitable for all types of data, and the interpretability method might not scale well with model complexity.

This is a relevant and interesting question in the field of neural network research.

2. **Comprehensive Background:** The introduction provides a thorough background on the topic, referencing key works in the field. This helps situate the current study within the broader context of neural network research and highlights the significance of the problem being addressed.

3. **Methodological Rigor:** The authors employ a rigorous methodology, including the use of Bayesian optimization to explore the space of architectures and hyperparameters. This demonstrates a commitment to ensuring that the shallow models are trained as effectively as possible.

4. **Detailed Methodology:** The paper provides a detailed description of the experimental methodology, including model compression, distillation, and mimic learning via L2 regression on logits. This transparency allows for reproducibility and a better understanding of the experimental setup.

5. **Negative Results:** The paper does not shy away from presenting negative results, which are valuable for the research community. It clearly states that shallow models, even when optimized, do not match the accuracy of deep models on CIFAR-10, reinforcing the importance of depth and convolution in neural networks.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Novelty:** While the paper revisits an important question, it does not introduce significant novel techniques or insights beyond what has been previously explored by Ba and Caruana (2014) and others. The study primarily confirms existing knowledge rather than expanding it.

"
base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation by introducing a new metric called Central Moment Discrepancy (CMD) for matching domain-specific hidden representations in neural networks. The authors propose that CMD, which matches higher-order central moments, can effectively reduce domain discrepancy without the computational overhead associated with other methods like Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD).

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The introduction of CMD as a metric for domain adaptation is a significant contribution. The paper provides a theoretical foundation for CMD, proving it as a metric and showing its implications for convergence in distribution.

2. **Theoretical Rigor**: The authors offer a probability-theoretic analysis to support their claims about CMD, which adds credibility to their approach. The proof that CMD is a metric and its implications for distribution convergence are well-articulated.

3. **Practical Implications**: The paper claims state-of-the-art performance on several domain adaptation tasks, which suggests that CMD is not only theoretically sound but also practically effective.

4. **Computational Efficiency**: CMD does not require the computationally expensive kernel matrix computations that MMD does, which is a significant advantage in terms of scalability and efficiency.

5. **Parameter Sensitivity**: The analysis showing CMD's insensitivity to parameter changes is valuable, as it suggests robustness and reduces the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning.

### Weaknesses

base,gpt-4o,"**Title: PixelVAE: A Latent Variable Model for Image Generation**

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper introduces PixelVAE, a novel model that combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and PixelCNNs. This hybrid approach leverages the latent variable framework of VAEs and the autoregressive capabilities of PixelCNNs, potentially offering a more powerful generative model for images.

2. **Hierarchical Model:** The extension of PixelVAE to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers is a significant contribution. This allows the model to capture both global and local structures in images, which is crucial for generating high-quality images.

3. **Empirical Results:** The paper provides strong empirical results, demonstrating that PixelVAE achieves state-of-the-art likelihood on MNIST and competitive performance on more challenging datasets like 64x64 ImageNet and LSUN bedrooms. The model's ability to generate high-quality samples and learn meaningful latent representations is well-supported by the experiments.

4. **Computational Efficiency:** By using fewer PixelCNN layers and relying on latent variables to capture global structure, PixelVAE reduces computational costs compared to standard PixelCNN implementations. This is a practical advantage for scaling to larger datasets.

5. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The paper evaluates the model on multiple datasets and provides a thorough comparison with existing methods, highlighting the advantages of PixelVAE in terms of likelihood, sample quality, and latent representation learning.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Clarity:** The paper introduces a complex model architecture, which may be difficult for readers to fully grasp without additional clarification. The description of the hierarchical architecture and the mathematical formulation could be more clearly explained.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** While the paper highlights the strengths of PixelVAE, it does not sufficiently discuss the potential limitations or challenges of the approach. For instance, the impact of the hierarchical structure on training stability and convergence is not addressed.

3. **Lack of Ablation Studies:** The paper could benefit from ablation studies to better understand the contribution of each component of the model, such as the impact of the number of stochastic layers or the choice of autoregressive priors.

4. **Generalization to Other Domains:** The paper focuses primarily on image datasets. It would be valuable to discuss the potential applicability and performance of PixelVAE in other domains, such as text or audio, where generative models are also widely used.

human,human,"he authors provide an interesting, computational-complexity-driven approach for efficient softmax computation for language modeling based on GPUs. An adaptive softmax approach is proposed based on a hierarchical model. Dynamic programming is applied to optimize the structure of the hierarchical approach chosen here w.r.t. computational complexity based on GPUs. 

However, it remains unclear, how robust the specific configuration obtained from dynamic programming is w.r.t. performance/perplexity. Corresponding comparative results with perplexity-based clustering would be desirable. Especially, in Sec. 5, Paragraph Baselines, and Table 1, respectively, it would be interesting to see a result on HSM(PPL) (cf. Zweig et al. 2013).

AFAIK, the first successful application of an LSTM-based language model for large vocabulary was published by Sundermeyer et al. 2012 (see below), which is missing in the sumary of prior work on the bottom of p. 3.

Prior work on LSTM language modeling:

 - notation should not be reused (B is matrix in Eq. (3), and batch size in Sec. 4.1).

For instance, it would be beneficial to understand which specific aspects of the HIERENC model contribute most to the performance gains. Additionally, comparisons with more diverse baseline models could strengthen the evaluation.

3. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** The paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, the reliance on Freebase descriptions might not generalize well to other domains or languages. A discussion on these limitations and potential solutions would provide a more balanced view.

The algorithm's complexity is well-analyzed, and its efficiency is demonstrated empirically.

4. **Empirical Evaluation**: The paper includes empirical comparisons of INFERSSPN with belief propagation and α-expansion, showing that SSPNs can parse images in exponentially less time while achieving comparable energy levels. This demonstrates the practical applicability and efficiency of the proposed model.

5. **Comprehensive Literature Review**: The paper provides a thorough review of related work, situating SSPNs within the broader context of scene understanding, hierarchical random fields, image grammars, and neural parsing methods. This helps to clarify the novelty and relevance of the proposed approach.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Readability**: The paper is dense and may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with the technical background. Some sections, particularly those explaining the SSPN model and the INFERSSPN algorithm, could benefit from clearer explanations and more intuitive examples.

2. **Limited Experimental Scope**: While the empirical evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of SSPNs, it is limited in scope. The paper could be strengthened by including more diverse datasets and tasks to better showcase the versatility and robustness of the proposed model.

3. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The paper does not thoroughly discuss the assumptions and potential limitations of SSPNs. For instance, the reliance on submodular energy functions may restrict the types of relationships that can be modeled. A discussion on these aspects would provide a more balanced view of the model's applicability.

4. **Comparison with Neural Methods**: Although the paper mentions neural parsing methods, it does not provide a direct comparison with state-of-the-art"
base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents DRL-Sense, a novel framework for learning multi-sense word representations using reinforcement learning. The framework consists of two main modules: a sense selection module and a sense representation module. The authors claim that their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on contextual word similarities and comparable performance with word2vec using significantly less training data.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty**: The paper introduces a novel application of reinforcement learning to the problem of multi-sense word representation, which is a fresh approach compared to traditional clustering and probabilistic methods.

2. **Modular Design**: The separation into a sense selection module and a sense representation module is a clear and logical design choice, allowing for focused improvements in each area.

3. **Efficiency**: The authors emphasize the linear time complexity of their sense selection process, which is a significant advantage over some existing methods that have higher computational costs.

4. **Non-parametric Learning**: The framework supports non-parametric learning, which allows for automatic determination of the number of senses for each word, adding flexibility and robustness.

5. **Experimental Results**: The paper claims state-of-the-art performance on contextual word similarity tasks and efficiency in terms of training data usage, which are strong empirical results if validated.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Detail**: The paper lacks detailed explanations of the reinforcement learning process, including the specific algorithms used, the reward structure, and how the sense selection and representation modules interact during training.

2. **Experimental Validation**: While the paper claims state-of-the-art results, it does not provide sufficient experimental details, such as datasets used, evaluation metrics, and comparison with a comprehensive set of baselines.

3. **Theoretical Justification**: The paper could benefit from a more thorough theoretical justification of why reinforcement learning is particularly suited for this task, compared to other machine learning approaches.

4. **Clarity and Readability**: The paper contains some typographical errors and formatting issues (e.g., incomplete sentences and references), which detract from its readability and professionalism.

5. **Code Availability**: The authors mention that the code will be released after acceptance, but providing access to the code during the review process could help validate the claims and facilitate reproducibility.

human,human,"[UPDATE]
After going through the response from the author and the revision, I increased my review score for two reasons.
1. I thank the reviewers for further investigating the difference between yours and the other work (Scheduled sampling, Unsupervised learning using LSTM) and providing some insights about it.
This paper at least shows empirically that 100%-Pred scheme is better for high-dimensional video and for long-term predictions.
It would be good if the authors briefly discuss this in the final revision (either in the appendix or in the main text).

2. The revised paper contains more comprehensive results than before.
The presented result and discussion in this paper will be quite useful to the research community as high-dimensional video prediction involves large-scale experiments that are computationally expensive.

- Summary
This paper presents a new RNN architecture for action-conditional future prediction. The proposed architecture combines actions into the recurrent connection of the LSTM core, which performs better than the previous state-of-the-art architecture [Oh et al.]. The paper also explores and compares different architectures such as frame-dependent/independent mode and observation/prediction-dependent architectures. The experimental result shows that the proposed architecture with fully prediction-dependent training scheme achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several complex visual domains. It is also shown that the proposed prediction architecture can be used to improve exploration in a 3D environment.

- Novelty
The novelty of the proposed architecture is not strong. The difference between [Oh et al.] and this work is that actions are combined into the LSTM in this paper, while actions are combined after LSTM in [Oh et al.]. The jumpy prediction was already introduced by [Srivastava et al.] in the deep learning area. 

- Experiment
The experiments are well-designed and thorough. Specifically, the paper evaluates different training schemes and compares different architectures using several rich domains (Atari, 3D worlds). Besides, the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art results on many domains and presents an application for model-based exploration.

- Clarity
The paper is well-written and easy to follow.

- Overall 
Although the proposed architecture is not much novel, it achieves promising results on Atari games and 3D environments. In addition, the systematic evaluation of different architectures presented in the paper would be useful to the community.

This paper combines the recent progress in variational autoencoder and autoregressive density modeling in the proposed PixelVAE model. The paper shows that it can match the NLL performance of a PixelCNN with a PixelVAE that has a much shallower PixelCNN decoder.
I think the idea of capturing the global structure with a VAE and modeling the local structure with a PixelCNN decoder makes a lot of sense and can prevent the blurry reconstruction/samples of VAE. I specially like the hierarchical image generation experiments.

I have the following suggestions/concerns about the paper:

1) Is there any experiment showing that using the PixelCNN as the decoder of VAE will result in better disentangling of high-level factors of variations in the hidden code? For example, the authors can train a PixelVAE and VAE on MNIST with 2D hidden code and visualize the 2D hidden code for test images and color code each hidden code based on the digit and show that the digits have a better separation in the PixelVAE representation. A semi-supervised classification comparison between VAE and the PixelVAE will also significantly improve the quality of the paper.

2) A similar idea is also presented in a concurrent ICLR submission ""Variational Lossy Autoencoder"". It would be interesting to have a discussion included in the paper and compare these works.

3) The answer to the pre-review questions made the architecture details of the paper much more clear, but I still ask the authors to include the exact architecture details of all the experiments in the paper and/or open source the code. The clarity of the presentation is not satisfying and the experiments are difficult to reproduce.

4) As pointed out in my pre-review question, it would be great to include two sets of MNIST samples maybe in an appendix section. One with PixelCNN and the other with PixelVAE with the same pixelcnn depth to illustrate the hidden code in PixelVAE actually captures the global structure.

I will gladly raise the score if the authors address my concerns."

"
base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel approach to learning representations in deep neural networks using an information-theoretic framework, specifically the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. The authors propose a variational inference method to approximate the IB objective, which they call the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB). This approach aims to create representations that are maximally informative about the target variable while being minimally informative about the input data, thus balancing expressiveness and compression.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a novel method, VIB, which leverages variational inference to approximate the IB objective. This is a significant contribution as it allows the application of the IB principle to deep neural networks, which was previously computationally challenging.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper is grounded in solid theoretical concepts from information theory, such as mutual information and the data processing inequality. The use of the IB principle provides a clear and principled framework for defining what constitutes a good representation.

3. **Practical Implementation**: By using the reparameterization trick and Monte Carlo sampling, the authors make the VIB method practical for optimization using stochastic gradient descent. This is crucial for handling high-dimensional, continuous data, such as images.

4. **Robustness to Overfitting and Adversarial Inputs**: The paper claims that models trained with VIB are more robust to overfitting and adversarial inputs compared to deterministic models. This is an important advantage in real-world applications where data can be noisy or manipulated.

**Title:** Introduction of NewsQA: A New Dataset for Machine Comprehension

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Dataset Introduction:** The paper introduces NewsQA, a new large-scale dataset for machine comprehension, which addresses some of the limitations of existing datasets. This is a significant contribution to the field as it provides a new resource for training and evaluating machine comprehension models.

2. **Comprehensive Dataset Characteristics:** NewsQA is designed with several challenging features, such as answers being spans of arbitrary length, the presence of questions with no answers, and the absence of candidate answers. These characteristics make the dataset more reflective of real-world scenarios and push the boundaries of current machine comprehension models.

3. **Detailed Methodology:** The paper provides a clear and detailed description of the dataset collection methodology, including the four-stage process of article curation, question sourcing, answer sourcing, and validation. This transparency is valuable for reproducibility and for other researchers who may want to build upon this work.

4. **Comparison with Existing Datasets:** The paper effectively positions NewsQA within the landscape of existing datasets, highlighting its unique contributions and the specific gaps it aims to fill. This contextualization helps readers understand the importance and potential impact of NewsQA.

5. **Human vs. Machine Performance:** The paper includes an evaluation of human performance versus machine performance on the NewsQA dataset, demonstrating the current gap and the challenge posed by the dataset. This is crucial for setting benchmarks and motivating further research.

Clear description of methods and evaluation
Successfully employs and interprets a variety of evaluations
Solid demonstration of practicality of technique in real-world interactive
topic modeling

- Weaknesses:
Missing related work on anchor words
Evaluation on 20 Newsgroups is not ideal
Theoretical contribution itself is small 

- General Discussion:
The authors propose a new method of interactive user specification of topics
called Tandem Anchors. The approach leverages the anchor words algorithm, a
matrix-factorization approach to learning topic models, by replacing the
individual anchors inferred from the Gram-Schmidt algorithm with constructed
anchor pseudowords created by combining the sparse vector representations of
multiple words that for a topic facet. The authors determine that the use of a
harmonic mean function to construct pseudowords is optimal by demonstrating
that classification accuracy of document-topic distribution vectors using these
anchors produces the most improvement over Gram-Schmidt. They also demonstrate
that their work is faster than existing interactive methods, allowing
interactive iteration, and show in a user study that the multiword anchors are
easier and more effective for users.

Generally, I like this contribution a lot: it is a straightforward modification
of an existing algorithm that actually produces a sizable benefit in an
interactive setting. I appreciated the authors’ efforts to evaluate their
method on a variety of scales. While I think the technical contribution in
itself is relatively small (a strategy to assemble pseudowords based on topic
facets) the thoroughness of the evaluation merited having it be a full paper
instead of a short paper. It would have been nice to see more ideas as to how
to build these facets in the absence of convenient sources like category titles
in 20 Newsgroups or when initializing a topic model for interactive learning.

One frustration I had with this paper is that I find evaluation on 20
Newsgroups to not be great for topic modeling: the documents are widely
different lengths, preprocessing matters a lot, users have trouble making sense
of many of the messages, and naive bag-of-words models beat topic models by a
substantial margin. Classification tasks are useful shorthand for how well a
topic model corresponds to meaningful distinctions in the text by topic; a task
like classifying news articles by section or reviews by the class of the
subject of the review might be more appropriate. It would also have been nice
to see a use case that better appealed to a common expressed application of
topic models, which is the exploration of a corpus.

There were a number of comparisons I think were missing, as the paper contains
little reference to work since the original proposal of the anchor word model.
In addition to comparing against standard Gram-Schmidt, it would have been good
to see the method from Lee et. al. (2014), “Low-dimensional Embeddings for
Interpretable Anchor-based Topic Inference”. I also would have liked to have
seen references to Nguyen et. al. (2013), “Evaluating Regularized Anchor
Words” and Nguyen et. al. (2015) “Is Your Anchor Going Up or Down? Fast and
Accurate Supervised Topic Models”, both of which provide useful insights into
the anchor selection process.

human,human,"The paper analyzes the story endings (last sentence of a 5-sentence story) in
the corpus built for the story cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al. 2016), and
proposes a model based on character and word n-grams to classify story endings.
The paper also shows better performance on the story cloze task proper
(distinguishing between ""right"" and ""wrong"" endings) than prior work.

Whereas style analysis is an interesting area and you show better results than
prior work on the story cloze task, there are several issues with the paper.
First, how do you define ""style""? Also, the paper needs to be restructured (for
instance, your section
""Results"" actually mixes some results and new experiments) and clarified (see
below for questions/comments): right now, it is quite difficult for the reader
to follow what data is used for the different experiments, and what data the
discussion refers to.

(1) More details about the data used is necessary in order to assess the claim
that ""subtle writing task [...] imposes different styles on the author"" (lines
729-732). How many stories are you looking at, written by how many different
persons? And how many stories are there per person? From your description of
the post-analysis of coherence, only pairs of stories written by the same
person in which one was judged as ""coherent"" and the other one as ""neutral"" are
chosen. Can you confirm that this is the case? So perhaps your claim is
justified for your ""Experiment 1"". However my understanding is that in
experiment 2 where you compare ""original"" vs. ""right"" or ""original"" vs.
""wrong"", we do not have the same writers. So I am not convinced lines 370-373
are correct.

(2) A lot in the paper is simply stated without any justifications. For
instance how are the ""five frequent"" POS and words chosen? Are they the most
frequent words/POS? (Also theses tables are puzzling: why two bars in the
legend for each category?). Why character *4*-grams? Did you tune that on the
development set? If these were not the most frequent features, but some that
you chose among frequent POS and words, you need to justify this choice and
especially link the choice to ""style"". How are these features reflecting
""style""?

(3) I don't understand how the section ""Design of NLP tasks"" connects to the
rest of the paper, and to your results. But perhaps this is because I am lost
in what ""training"" and ""test"" sets refer to here.

(4) It is difficult to understand how your model differs from previous work.
How do we reconcile lines 217-219 (""These results suggest that real
understanding of text is required in order to solve the task"") with your
approach?

(5) The terminology of ""right"" and ""wrong"" endings is coming from Mostafazadeh
et al., but this is a very bad choice of terms. What exactly does a ""right"" or
""wrong"" ending mean (""right"" as in ""coherent"" or ""right"" as in ""morally good"")?
I took a quick look, but couldn't find the exact prompts given to the Turkers.
I think this needs to be clarified: as it is, the first paragraph of your
section ""Story cloze task"" (lines 159-177) is not understandable.

Other questions/comments:

Table 1. Why does the ""original"" story differ from the coherent and incoherent
one? From your description of the corpus, it seems that one Turker saw the
first 4 sentences of the original story and was then ask to write one sentence
ending the story in a ""right"" way (or did they ask to provide a ""coherent""
ending?) and one sentence ending the story in a ""wrong"" way (or did they ask to
provide an ""incoherent"" ending)? I don't find the last sentence of the
""incoherent"" story that incoherent... If the only shoes that Kathy finds great
are $300, I can see how Kathy doesn't like buying shoes ;-) This led me to
wonder how many Turkers judged the coherence of the story/ending and how
variable the judgements were. What criterion was used to judge a story coherent
or incoherent? Also does one Turker judge the coherence of both the ""right"" and
""wrong"" endings, making it a relative judgement? Or was this an absolute
judgement? This would have huge implications on the ratings.

Lines 380-383: What does ""We randomly sample 5 original sets"" mean?

Line 398: ""Virtually all sentences""? Can you quantify this?

Table 5: Could we see the weights of the features? 

Line 614: ""compared to ending an existing task"": the Turkers are not ending a
""task""

Line 684-686: ""made sure each pair of endings was written by the same author""
-> this is true for the ""right""/""wrong"" pairs, but not for the ""original""-""new""
pairs, according to your description.

Line 694: ""shorter text spans"": text about what? This is unclear.

Lines 873-875: where is this published?"
base,gpt-4o,"**Title: Learning Continuous Semantic Representations of Symbolic Expressions**

**Review:**

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:**
   - The paper introduces a novel architecture, Neural Equivalence Networks (EQNETs), designed to learn continuous semantic representations (SEMVECs) of symbolic expressions. This is a significant contribution as it addresses the challenge of representing semantically equivalent but syntactically diverse expressions in a continuous space.

2. **Problem Formulation:**
   - The authors clearly articulate the problem of learning SEMVECs and highlight the complexity and importance of this task. They provide a strong motivation for why existing models like TREENNs and RNNs fall short in capturing the semantic equivalence of symbolic expressions.

3. **Methodological Innovation:**
   - EQNETs are designed to handle large semantic changes in expressions as they progress up the syntax tree, which is a key innovation over traditional recursive neural networks. The use of residual-like multi-layer networks and the introduction of subexpression forcing are innovative approaches to improve the learning of semantic equivalence.

4. **Experimental Evaluation:**
   - The paper provides an extensive evaluation of EQNETs on a diverse set of symbolic algebraic and boolean expressions. The results demonstrate that EQNETs outperform existing architectures, which supports the claims made by the authors.

5. **Clarity and Structure:**
   - The paper is well-structured, with a clear introduction, problem statement, and detailed explanation of the proposed model. The use of diagrams (e.g., Figure 1) helps in understanding the architecture of EQNETs.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Complexity and Scalability:**
   - While the paper addresses the problem of learning SEMVECs, it does not sufficiently discuss the computational complexity and scalability of EQNETs, especially for very large expressions or datasets. This could be a potential limitation in practical applications.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:**
   - The paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of EQNETs. For instance, how do EQNETs perform on expressions that are significantly more complex than those in the training set? Are there specific types of expressions where EQNETs might struggle?

3. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Although the paper claims that EQNETs outperform TREENNs and RNNs, a more detailed comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art models in symbolic representation learning would strengthen the evaluation. It would be beneficial to include more baseline models for comparison"
base,gpt-4o,"**Title: Self-Ensembling for Semi-Supervised Learning**

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper introduces a novel method of self-ensembling during training, which leverages the outputs of a single network across different epochs and under varying conditions. This is a creative extension of the ensemble learning concept, applied in a semi-supervised learning context.

2. **Practical Relevance:** The proposed methods, Π-model and temporal ensembling, address the challenge of semi-supervised learning, which is highly relevant in scenarios where labeled data is scarce. The ability to improve classification accuracy with limited labeled data is a significant contribution.

3. **Comprehensive Explanation:** The paper provides a detailed explanation of the Π-model and temporal ensembling, including pseudocode and a clear description of the loss functions used. This makes the methods accessible and reproducible for other researchers.

4. **Performance Improvement:** The paper claims that both methods surpass prior state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised learning by a considerable margin. This suggests that the methods are not only theoretically sound but also practically effective.

5. **Robustness to Noisy Labels:** The methods are noted to improve classification accuracy even in fully labeled cases and provide tolerance against incorrect labels, which is a valuable property in real-world applications where data quality can be variable.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Experimental Results:** The paper does not include any experimental results or quantitative comparisons with existing methods. This makes it difficult to assess the actual performance improvements claimed by the authors.

2. **Limited Theoretical Analysis:** While the paper provides a practical approach, it lacks a deep theoretical analysis of why the proposed methods work better than existing techniques. A more rigorous theoretical foundation could strengthen the paper.

3. **Complexity and Scalability:** The paper does not discuss the computational complexity or scalability of the proposed methods. It would be beneficial to understand how these methods perform on large-scale datasets and whether they introduce significant computational overhead.

4. **Generalization to Other Domains:** The paper focuses on image classification networks. It would be useful to discuss how the proposed methods could be generalized to other domains or types of neural networks.

5. **Comparison with Related Work:** Although the paper mentions related work, such as the ladder network and bootstrapping methods, it does not provide a detailed comparison or highlight the specific advantages of the proposed methods over these existing techniques.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Include Experimental Results:** Adding experimental results with quantitative metrics would greatly enhance"
human,human,"This paper is about improving feature learning in deep reinforcement learning, by augmenting the main policy's optimization problem with terms corresponding to (domain-independent) auxiliary tasks. These tasks are about control (learning other policies that attempt to maximally modify the state space, i.e. here the pixels), immediate reward prediction, and value function replay. Except for the latter, these auxiliary tasks are only used to help shape the features (by sharing the CNN+LSTM feature extraction network). Experiments show the benefits of this approach on Atari and Labyrinth problems, with in particular much better data efficiency than A3C.

The paper is well written, ideas are sound, and results pretty convincing, so to me this is a clear acceptance. At high level I only have few things to say, none being of major concern:
- I believe you should say something about the extra computational cost of optimizing these auxiliary tasks. How much do you lose in terms of training speed? Which are the most costly components?
- If possible, please try to make it clearer in the abstract / intro that the agent is learning different policies for each task. When I read in the abstract that the agent ""also maximises many other pseudo-reward functions simultaneously by reinforcement learning"", my first understanding was that it learned a single policy to optimize all rewards together, and I realized my mistake only when reaching eq. 1.
- The ""feature control"" idea is not validated empirically (the preliminary experiment in Fig. 5 is far from convincing as it only seems to help slightly initially). I like that idea but I am worried by the fact the task is changing during learning, since the extracted features are being modified. There might be stability / convergence issues at play here.
- Since as you mentioned, ""the performance of our agents is still steadily improving"", why not keep them going to see how far they go? (at least the best ones)
- Why aren't the auxiliary tasks weight parameters (the lambda_*) hyperparameters to optimize? Were there any experiments to validate that using 1 was a good choice?
- Please mention the fact that auxiliary tasks are not trained with ""true"" Q-Learning since they are trained off-policy with more than one step of empirical rewards (as discussed in the OpenReview comments)

Minor stuff:
- ""Policy gradient algorithms adjust the policy to maximise the expected reward, L_pi = -..."" => that's actually a loss to be minimized
- In eq. 1 lambda_c should be within the sum
- Just below eq. 1 r_t^(c) should be r_t+k^(c)
- Figure 2 does not seem to be referenced in the text, also Figure 1(d) should be referenced in 3.3
- ""the features discovered in this manner is shared"" => are shared
- The text around eq. 2 refers to the loss L_PC but that term is not defined and is not (explicitly) in eq. 2
- Please explain what ""Clip"" means for dueling networks in the legend of Figure 3
- I would have liked to see more ablated versions on Atari, to see in particular if the same patterns of individual contribution as on Labyrinth were observed
- In the legend of Figure 3 the % mentioned are for Labyrinth, which is not clear from the text.
- In 4.1.2: ""Figure 3 (right) shows..."" => it is actually the top left plot of the figure. Also later ""This is shown in Figure 3 Top"" should be Figure 3 Top Right.
- ""Figure 5 shows the learning curves for the top 5 hyperparameter settings on three Labyrinth navigation levels"" => I think it is referring to the left and middle plots of the figure, so only on two levels (the text above might also need fixing)
- In 4.2: ""The left side shows the average performance curves of the top 5 agents for all three methods the right half shows..."" => missing a comma or something after ""methods""
- Appendix: ""Further details are included in the supplementary materials."" => where are they?
- What is the value of lambda_PC? (=1 I guess?)

human,human,"Game of tic-tac-toe is considered. 1029 tic-tac-toe board combinations are chosen so that a single move will result into victory of either the black or the white player. There are 18 possible moves - 2 players x 9 locations. A CNN is trained from a visual rendering of the game board to these 18 possible outputs. CAM technique is used to visualize the salient regions in the inputs responsible for the prediction that CNN makes. Authors find that predictions correspond to the winning board locations. 

Authors claim that this:
1. is a very interesting finding. 
2. CNN has figured out game rules. 
3. Cross modal supervision is applicable to higher-level semantics. 

I don't think (2) be can be claimed because the knowledge of game rules is not tested by any experiment. There is only ""one"" stage of a game - i.e. last move that is considered. Further, the results are on the training set itself - the bare minimum requirement of any implicit or explicit representation of game rules is the ability to act in previously unseen states (i.e. generalization). Even if the CNN did generalize, I would avoid making any claims about knowledge of game rules. 

For (3), author's definition of cross-modal seems to be training from images to games moves. In image-classification we go from images --> labels (i.e. between two different domains). We already know CNNs can perform such mappings. CNNs have been used to map images to actions such as in DQN my Mnih et al., or DDPG by Lillicrap et al. and a lot of other classical work such as ALVIN. It's unclear what points authors are trying to make. 

For (1): how interesting is an implicit attention mechanism is a subjective matter. The authors claim a difference between the concepts of ""what do do"" and ""what will happen"". They claim by supervising for ""what will happen"", the CNN can automatically learn about ""what to do"". This is extensively studied in the model predictive control literature. Where model is ""what will happen next"", and the model is used to infer a control law - ""what to do"". However, in the experimental setup presented in the paper what will happen and what to do seem to be the exact same things. 

For further analysis of what the CNN has learnt I would recommend:
(a) Visualizing CAM with respect to incorrect classes. For eg, visualize the CAM with respect to player would lose (instead of winning).

(b) Split the data into train/val and use the predictions on the val-set for visualization. These would be much more informative about what kind of ""generalizable"" features the CNN pays attention to. 

In summary, understanding why CNN's make what decisions they make is a very interesting area of research. While the emergence of an implicit attention mechanism may be considered to be an interesting finding by some, many claims made by the authors are not supported by experiments (see comments above).

base,gpt-4o,"**Review of the Paper**

**Title:** The paper does not provide a title, but it appears to focus on a novel approach for synset induction using a method called WATSET.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:** The paper introduces a novel approach, WATSET, for resolving ambiguities in synonymy relations and inducing synsets. This is a significant contribution, especially for languages lacking comprehensive lexical resources like WordNet.

2. **Relevance:** The problem addressed is highly relevant to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), particularly in the context of languages with limited resources. The ability to automatically construct WordNet-like resources can greatly enhance NLP applications in these languages.

3. **Comparison with Existing Methods:** The paper provides a clear comparison between WATSET and existing methods like BabelNet and UBY, highlighting the advantages of the proposed approach, such as avoiding error-prone mapping and machine translation procedures.

4. **Methodology:** The use of fuzzy graph clustering for synset induction is well-motivated. The paper outlines the process of transforming human-readable synonymy relations into disambiguated machine-readable synsets.

5. **Implementation and Availability:** The paper mentions that an implementation of WATSET is available online, which is a strength as it allows for reproducibility and further research by others in the field.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Detail in Methodology:** While the paper introduces the WATSET method, it lacks detailed explanations of the algorithmic steps involved. For instance, how exactly does the meta-algorithm for fuzzy graph clustering work? More technical details and possibly pseudocode would be beneficial.

2. **Evaluation and Results:** The paper does not provide any empirical results or evaluation metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of WATSET compared to other methods. Including quantitative results would strengthen the claims of outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

3. **Clarity and Structure:** The paper's structure is somewhat disjointed, with sections abruptly ending and lacking continuity. For example, the introduction ends without a clear transition to the related work section. Additionally, the paper seems to be missing sections or pages, as indicated by the abrupt numbering and incomplete sentences.

4. **Literature Review:** While the paper discusses related work, it could benefit from a more comprehensive literature review that includes recent advancements in synset induction and word sense disambiguation.

base,llama-3,"1 INTRODUCTION
One of the goals of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to build autonomous agents that can learn and adapt to new environments. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a key technique for achieving such adaptability. The goal of RL algorithms is to learn an optimal policy for choosing actions that maximize some notion of long term performance. Transferring knowledge gained from tasks solved earlier to solve a new target task can help, either in terms of speeding up the learning process or in terms of achieving a better solution, among other performance measures. When applied to RL, transfer could be accomplished in many ways (see Taylor & Stone (2009; 2011) for a very good survey of the field). One could use the value function from the source task as an initial estimate in the target task to cut down exploration [Sorg & Singh (2009)]. Alternatively one could use policies from the source task(s) in the target task. This can take one of two forms - (i) the derived policies can be used as initial exploratory trajectories [Atkeson & Schaal (1997); Niekum et al. (2013)] in the target task and (ii) the derived policy could be used to define macro-actions which may then be used by the agent in solving the target task [Mannor et al. (2004); Brunskill & Li (2014)].
∗Authors contributed equally
While transfer in RL has been much explored, there are two crucial issues that have not been adequately addressed in the literature. The first is negative transfer, which occurs when the transfer results in a performance that is worse when compared to learning from scratch in the target task. This severely limits the applicability of many transfer techniques only to cases for which some measure of relatedness between source and target tasks can be guaranteed beforehand. This brings us to the second problem with transfer, which is the issue of identifying an appropriate source task from which to transfer. In some scenarios, different source tasks might be relevant and useful for different parts of the state space of the target task. As a real world analogy, consider multiple players (experts) who are good at different aspects of a game (say, tennis). For example, Player 1 is good at playing backhand shots while Player 2 is good at playing forehand shots. Consider the case of a new player (agent) who wants to learn tennis by selectively learning from these two experts. We handle such a situation in our architecture by allowing the agent to learn how to"

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Novelty:** The paper addresses a significant challenge in AI and gaming by focusing on micromanagement in StarCraft, a complex real-time strategy game. This is a relevant and timely topic given the increasing interest in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to complex, multi-agent environments.

2. **Clear Problem Definition:** The authors clearly define the problem of micromanagement in StarCraft, distinguishing it from other RL tasks by emphasizing the challenges of large action spaces and the need for coherent multi-agent control.

3. **Comprehensive Literature Review:** The paper provides a thorough review of related work, situating the study within the broader context of multi-agent RL and previous AI approaches to StarCraft. This helps readers understand the novelty and contribution of the proposed methods.

4. **Proposed Methodology:** The introduction of the zero order (ZO) reinforcement learning algorithm is a novel approach to address exploration challenges in micromanagement tasks. The idea of exploring directly in policy space by mixing parameter randomization and gradient descent is innovative.

5. **Task Design:** The paper proposes specific micromanagement tasks in StarCraft, which are well-suited to evaluate the performance of RL algorithms in a controlled setting. This task design allows for a focused study on micromanagement without the complexity of full-game strategies.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Experimental Results:** The paper does not provide experimental results or evaluations of the proposed methods. This makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness and practical impact of the zero order RL algorithm and the proposed task scenarios.

2. **Complexity and Scalability:** While the paper introduces a novel approach, it does not sufficiently address the scalability of the proposed methods to larger, more complex scenarios or full games of StarCraft. The discussion on computational efficiency and scalability is limited.

3. **Details on Implementation:** The paper lacks detailed information on the implementation of the proposed methods, such as the architecture of the deep neural network model, the specific features used for state-action representation, and the parameters for the greedy inference approach.

4. **Comparative Analysis:** There is no comparative analysis with existing methods or baselines. Including such comparisons would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the advantages or limitations of the proposed approach relative to other techniques.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:**
   - The paper addresses a relatively unexplored area of adversarial attacks on generative models, specifically Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and VAE-GANs. This is a novel contribution as most adversarial research has focused on classification models.

2. **Clear Motivation:**
   - The authors provide a clear motivation for why attacking generative models is important, particularly in scenarios where encoding and decoding are separated, which could lead to security vulnerabilities.

3. **Comprehensive Background:**

4. **Technical Depth:**
   - The explanation of the VAE architecture and the associated loss function is detailed and technically sound, providing a solid foundation for the proposed attacks.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Experimental Results:**
   - The paper does not provide experimental results or empirical evidence to support the claims about the effectiveness of the proposed attacks on VAEs and VAE-GANs. This is a significant omission as it leaves the reader without a sense of how well the attacks perform in practice.

2. **Limited Discussion on Practical Implications:**
   - While the paper discusses potential scenarios for attacks, it lacks a detailed discussion on the practical implications and potential real-world impact of such attacks on generative models.

3. **Comparison with Related Work:**
   - Although the paper mentions related work, it does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed methods with existing adversarial attacks on generative models, such as those mentioned in Tabacof et al. (2016).

4. **Clarity and Organization:**
   - The paper could benefit from improved organization and clarity, particularly in the sections discussing the proposed attacks. The transition from background to the novel contributions is not very smooth, which might confuse readers.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Include Experimental Results:**
   - Conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adversarial attacks on VAEs and VAE-GANs. Include metrics such as success rate, perturbation size, and visual examples of adversarial inputs and their reconstructions.

2. **Enhance Practical Discussion:**
   - Expand the discussion on the practical implications of the attacks. Consider potential defenses and how these attacks could affect applications using generative models.

human,human,"This paper presents design decisions of TerpreT [1] and experiments about learning simple loop programs and list manipulation tasks. The TerpreT line of work (is one of those which) bridges the gap between the programming languages (PL) and machine learning (ML) communities. Contrasted to the recent interest of the ML community for program induction, the focus here is on using the design of the programming language to reduce the search space. Namely, here, they used the structure of the control flow (if-then-else, foreach, zipWithi, and foldli ""templates""), immutable data (no reuse of a ""neural"" memory), and types (they tried penalizing ill-typedness, and restricting the search only to well-typed programs, which works better). My bird eye view would be that this stands in between ""make everything continuous and perform gradient descent"" (ML) and ""discretize all the things and perform structured and heuristics-guided combinatorial search"" (PL).

I liked that they have a relevant baseline (\lambda^2), but I wished that they also included a fully neural network program synthesis baseline. Admittedly, it would not succeed except on the simplest tasks, but I think some of their experimental tasks are simple enough for ""non-generating code "" NNs to succeed on.

I wished that TerpreT was available, and the code to reproduce these experiments too.

I wonder if/how the (otherwise very interesting!) recommendations for the design of programming languages to perform gradient descent based-inductive programming would hold/perform on harder task than these loops. Even though these tasks are already interesting and challenging, I wonder how much of these tasks biased the search for good subset of constraints (e.g. those for structuring the control flow).

Overall, I think that the paper is good enough to appear at ICLR, but I am no expert in program induction / synthesis.

Writing:
 - The paper is at times hard to follow. For instance, the naming scheme of the model variants could be summarized in a table (with boolean information about the features it embeds).
 - Introduction: ""basis modern computing"" -> of
 - Page 3, training objective: ""minimize the cross-entropy between the distribution in the output register r_R^{(T)} and a point distribution with all probability mass on the correct output value"" -> if you want to cater to the ML community at large, I think that it is better to say that you treat the output of r_R^{(T)} as a classification problem with the correct output value (you can give details and say exactly which type of criterion/loss, cross-entropy, you use).

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Hybrid Approach:** The paper introduces the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), which combines the strengths of both top-down and bottom-up approaches to physical reasoning. This hybrid approach is innovative as it seeks to leverage the expressivity of symbolic physics engines while maintaining the adaptability of neural networks.

2. **Clear Motivation and Context:** The introduction effectively sets the stage by discussing the importance of intuitive physics in human reasoning and the challenges in replicating this in artificial agents. The paper clearly articulates the need for a system that can generalize across different scenarios without retraining.

3. **Focus on Generalization:** The paper emphasizes the importance of generalization across variable object counts and scene configurations, which is a critical aspect of building robust AI systems. The proposed framework's ability to handle these variations is a significant contribution.

4. **Detailed Framework Description:** The paper provides a comprehensive description of the NPE framework, including its key ingredients such as object-based representations, pairwise factorization, and compositionality. This detailed explanation helps in understanding how the NPE is designed to achieve its goals.

5. **Separation of Vision and Dynamics:** The decision to separate visual properties from physical dynamics is well-justified, aiming for a more general-purpose physics engine. This separation is a thoughtful design choice that aligns with the goal of achieving robust generalization.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Experimental Results:** The paper does not provide experimental results or quantitative evaluations of the NPE's performance. Without empirical evidence, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach in practice.

2. **Limited Scope of Application:** The paper focuses on two-dimensional worlds of balls and obstacles, which may limit the perceived applicability of the NPE to more complex, real-world scenarios. The simplicity of the testbed might not fully demonstrate the potential of the framework.

3. **Insufficient Comparison with Existing Methods:** While the paper discusses the strengths and weaknesses of top-down and bottom-up approaches, it lacks a detailed comparison of the NPE's performance against existing state-of-the-art methods in physical reasoning.

This hybrid architecture, termed Layer Recurrent Neural Network (L-RNN), is a creative extension of the ReNet architecture and offers a new perspective on leveraging RNNs for spatial dependencies.

2. **Comprehensive Introduction:** The introduction provides a thorough background on the importance of multi-scale contextual information in computer vision tasks and situates the proposed method within the context of existing architectures. It effectively highlights the limitations of traditional CNNs and the potential of RNNs to address these issues.

3. **Technical Depth:** The paper delves into the technical details of the L-RNN module, explaining the architecture and the mathematical formulation clearly. The use of bidirectional spatial RNNs to scan feature maps in different directions is well-articulated, providing a solid understanding of how the model captures spatial dependencies.

4. **Integration with Pre-trained Networks:** The ability to integrate L-RNN modules into pre-trained CNNs without the need for retraining the entire network is a practical advantage. This approach can save computational resources and time, making it appealing for real-world applications.

5. **Experimental Validation:** The paper mentions experiments on CIFAR-10 and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the L-RNN in improving performance. The use of Layer Normalization to train vanilla RNNs to match GRU performance with fewer parameters is a noteworthy contribution.

human,human,"Dear reviewers, 
 
thanks for your detailed reviews. We will use them to improve our paper. We tried to gather them in different categories in oder to address them properly. 
Feel free to come back to us if you have some remaining questions.
 
Elena, Flavian & Thomas
 
Common themes:
     • We do not do end-to-end learning (I.1. & III.1)
        ◦ TL;DR: A modular architecture is the easiest way to put in production such a complex model - efficient way of computational resources (as also ack by the first reviewer)
           ▪ the fact that we specialize each modality-specific network to the final task independently allows us to scale better by reducing the parameter space and the resulting computation time, gives us better interpretability and insight into the relative value of each modality (as raised by reviewer #2) and allows us to better control any convergence issues in a production environment.
           ▪ the fact that during specialization we do not backprop through the full ImageCNN network is based on previous findings (see 'Learning visual clothing style with heterogeneous dyadic co-occurences’ for instance)  that show that the fc7 layer provides a good cross-task representation for images. For the other two networks we do backprop all the way down.
         ◦ Using pretrained models for each modality allows us to leverage external source of data and do transfer learning, whose value was repeatedly confirmed in the literature such as 'How transferable are features in deep NN?' for instance. 
         ◦ We agree that in the limit given enough data and computational resources the models can be learnt from scratch and in a joint manner, but our concern is on delivering a simple solution that can be delivered in production setting and at very large scale.
     • ResNet motivation (I.2. & II.2)
         ◦ We decided to use “residual” in describing our new pairwise embedding layer based on the similarity in motivation with the original residual unit that was introduced to help the system approximate the identity and allows the new layers to focus on the remaining unexplained error. We agree that in our case the layer does not serve the same practical purpose as in the original ResNets architectures that use the unit mostly for training very deep networks.
     • Missing baselines
         ◦ the state of the art on this dataset (I.3.b & III.3.)
            ▪ ImageCNN is the McAuley et al solution that introduced the dataset (He used GoogLeNet and we used AlexNet)
            ▪ VBPR is another baseline introduced by He & McAuley. It uses reviews as implicit feedback and try to predict the interest of a user based on products images and the sequence of products he was interested in. Our approach focuses more on a item to item similarity matrix and that is why we have not implemented this approach.   
         ◦ jointly fine-tuned model (I.1)
            ▪ We agree that we could respecialize the networks jointly and its on our list of remaining experiments to try 
         ◦ additional fully-connected layer that mixes the modality specific embeddings to form a final embedding (I.2)
            ▪ We agree that having an additional full connected layer that compress into a lower dimension vector could be a good idea. However we did not manage to make it work. We’ll try different initialisations in the next version of the paper.
 
Other concerns:
   • TextCNN setup details (I.3.a.)
         ◦ As per not providing more info on training the TextCNN, we choose to not add more info as our paper was running long as it was. For more specific info, please let us know what details are you interested in.
         ◦ Concerning the choice of keeping only the first 10 words, we agree that we could have kept more, however a lot of the descriptions were empty so we did not feel we need to make them longer. However, the architecture allows to choose an arbitrary length for the text input. 
    • The paper should clearly motivate and show how different modalities contribute to the final task. (II.1.)
         ◦ We agree and this is why we reported separately the performance of each modality network in Tables 1 & 2
         ◦ Something we did not mention is that in Content2Vec-linear model the image and text modalities have very similar coefficients 
    • The choice of the term embedding for the dot product of two items is not usual.  Here it refers to the final output, and renders the output layer in Figure 2 pointless. (II.3.a.)
         ◦ In the Content2Vec-crossfeat and Content2Vec-embedpairs we do have a pair embedding layer (one using polynomial features, one using a real embedding representation) so this is why we differentiate  between the Output layer (the softmax) and the Pairwise layer in Figure 2.
    • This architecture makes it hard to say how easily the model would generalize to arbitrary feature types, say e.g. if I had audio or video features describing the item. (III.2.)
         ◦ The modular design assumes that the input modalities do have extra modeling value for the pairwise similarity prediction. To your point, if interested in song similarities, if shown that text and audio signals do separately predict video similarities (as shown in "
human,human,"Summary:
This paper proposes a regularizer that is claimed to help escaping from the saddle points. The method is inspired from physics, such that thinking of the optimization process is moving a positively charged particle would over the error surface which would be pushed away from saddle points due to the saddle point being positively changed as well. Authors of the paper show results over several different datasets.

Overview of the Review:
    Pros:
        - The idea is very interesting.
        - The diverse set of results on different datasets.
    Cons:
        - The justification is not strong enough.
        - The paper is not well-written.
        - Experiments are not convincing enough.

Criticisms:

I liked the idea and the intuitions coming from the paper. However, I think this paper is not written well. There are some variables introduced in the paper and not explained good-enough, for example in 2.3, the authors start to talk about p without introducing and defining it properly. The only other place it appears before is Equation 6. The Equations need some work as well, some work is needed in terms of improving the flow of the paper, e.g., introducing all the variables properly before using them.

Equation 6 appears without a proper explanation and justification. It is necessary to explain it what it means properly since I think this is one of the most important equation in this paper. More analysis on what it means in terms of optimization point of view would also be appreciated.

$\phi$ is not a parameter, it is a function which has its own hyper-parameter $\alpha$. 

It would be interesting to report validation or test results on a few tasks as well. Since this method introduced as an additional cost function, its effect on the validation/test results would be interesting as well.
The authors should discuss more on how they choose the hyper-parameters of their models. 

The Figure 2 and 3 does not add too much to the paper and they are very difficult to understand or draw any conclusions from. 

There are lots of Figures under 3.4.2 without any labels of captions. Some of them are really small and difficult to understand since the labels on the figures appear very small and somewhat unreadable.


A small question:

* Do you also backpropagate through $\tilde{\mW}_i^t$?"
human,human,"In light of the authors' responsiveness and the updates to the manuscript -- in particular to clarify the meta-learning task -- I am updating my score to an 8.

-----

This manuscript proposes to tackle few-shot learning with neural networks by leveraging meta-learning, a classic idea that has seen a renaissance in the last 12 months. The authors formulate few-shot learning as a sequential meta-learning problem: each ""example"" includes a sequence of batches of ""training"" pairs, followed by a final ""test"" batch. The inputs at each ""step"" include the outputs of a ""base learner"" (e.g., training loss and gradients), as well as the base learner's current state (parameters). The paper applies an LSTM to this meta-learning problem, using the inner memory cells in the *second* layer to directly model the updated parameters of the base learner. In doing this, they note similarities between the respective update rules of LSTM memory cells and gradient descent. Updates to the LSTM meta-learner are computed based on the base learner's prediction loss for the final ""test"" batch. The authors make several simplifying assumptions, such as sharing weights across all second layer cells (analogous to using the same learning rate for all parameters). The paper recreates the Mini-ImageNet data set proposed in Vinyals et al 2016, and shows that the meta-learner LSTM is competitive with the current state-of-the-art (Matchin Networks, Vinyals 2016) on 1- and 5-shot learning.

Strengths:
- It is intriguing -- and in hindsight, natural -- to cast the few-shot learning problem as a sequential (meta-)learning problem. While the authors did not originate the general idea of persisting learning across a series of learning problems, I think it is fair to say that they have advanced the state of the art, though I cannot confidently assert its novelty as I am not deeply familiar with recent work on meta-learning.
- The proposed approach is competitive with and outperforms Vinyals 2016 in 1-shot and 5-shot Mini-ImageNet experiments.
- The base learner in this setting (simple ConvNet classifier) is quite different from the nearest-neighbor-on-top-of-learned-embedding approach used in Vinyals 2016. It is always exciting when state-of-the-art results can be reported using very different approaches, rather than incremental follow-up work.
- As far as I know, the insight about the relationship between the memory cell and gradient descent updates is novel here. It is interesting regardless.
- The paper offers several practical insights about how to design and train an LSTM meta-learner, which should make it easier for others to replicate this work and apply these ideas to new problems. These include proper initialization, weight sharing across coordinates, and the importance of normalizing/rescaling the loss, gradient, and parameter inputs. Some of the insights have been previously described (the importance of simulating test conditions during meta-training; assuming independence between meta-learner and base learner parameters when taking gradients with respect to the meta-learner parameters), but the discussion here is useful nonetheless.

Weaknesses:
- The writing is at times quite opaque. While it describes very interesting work, I would not call the paper an enjoyable read. It took me multiple passes (as well as consulting related work) to understand the general learning problem. The task description in Section 2 (Page 2) is very abstract and uses notation and language that is not common outside of this sub-area. The paper could benefit from a brief concrete example (based on MNIST is fine), perhaps paired with a diagram illustrating a sequence of few-shot learning tasks. This would definitely make it accessible to a wider audience.
- Following up on that note, the precise nature of the N-class, few-shot learning problem here is unclear to me. Specifically, the Mini-ImageNet data set has 100 labels, of which 64/16/20 are used during meta-training/validation/testing. Does this mean that only 64/100 classes are observed through meta-training? Or does it mean that only 64/100 are observed in each batch, but on average all 100 are observed during meta-training? If it's the former, how many outputs does the softmax layer of the ConvNet base learner have during meta-training? 64 (only those observed in training) or 100 (of which 36 are never observed)? Many other details like these are unclear (see question).
- The plots in Figure 2 are pretty uninformative in and of themselves, and the discussion section offers very little insight around them.

This is an interesting paper with convincing results. It seems like a fairly clear accept, but the presentation of the ideas and work therein could be improved. I will definitely raise my score if the writing is improved."
base,gpt-4o,"### Review of the Paper

#### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses a significant challenge in natural language processing (NLP) related to handling open vocabulary in neural language models. This is particularly relevant for morphologically-rich languages where traditional word-based models struggle with lexical coverage.

2. **Methodological Innovation**: The use of character-level embeddings through convolutional layers to infer word embeddings is a promising approach. This method allows the model to capture subword patterns, which can be beneficial for generalization, especially in languages with complex morphology.

3. **Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE)**: The application of NCE to handle the open vocabulary problem is a strong point. NCE is a well-regarded technique for dealing with the normalization issues in probabilistic models, and its use here is well-justified.

4. **Comprehensive Model Description**: The paper provides a detailed description of the model architecture, including the use of convolutional layers and the integration of character-level and word-level embeddings. This clarity helps in understanding the proposed approach.

5. **Experimental Setup**: The paper mentions a large-scale translation task in a reranking setting to evaluate the model, which is a practical and relevant application for testing the effectiveness of the proposed method.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Results**: The paper mentions that experimental results are summarized in section 4, but the provided text does not include these results. Without empirical evidence, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

2. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper could benefit from improved organization and clarity. Some sections, particularly those describing the model and the objective function, are dense and may be challenging for readers to follow without additional context or diagrams.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: There is no mention of how the proposed model compares to existing state-of-the-art models in terms of performance metrics. A comparative analysis would strengthen the paper by providing context for the improvements offered by the new approach.

4. **Scalability and Efficiency**: While the paper discusses the theoretical benefits of the proposed model, it does not address potential computational challenges or the scalability of the approach, especially when dealing with very large datasets.

5. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The paper does not sufficiently discuss the potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed method. For instance, the computational cost of character-level convolutions and the impact on training time are not addressed.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

human,human,"This paper explores different strategies for instance-level image retrieval with deep CNNs. The approach consists of extracting features from a network pre-trained for image classification (e.g. VGG), and post-process them for image retrieval. In other words, the network is off-the-shelf and solely acts as a feature extractor. The post-processing strategies are borrowed from traditional retrieval pipelines relying on hand-crafted features (e.g. SIFT + Fisher Vectors), denoted by the authors as ""traditional wisdom"".

Specifically, the authors examine where to extract features in the network (i.e. features are neurons activations of a convolution layer), which type of feature aggregation and normalization performs best, whether resizing images helps, whether combining multiple scales helps, and so on. 

While this type of experimental study is reasonable and well motivated, it suffers from a huge problem. Namely it ""ignores"" 2 major recent works that are in direct contradictions with many claims of the paper ([a] ""End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval"" by  Gordo et al. and [b] ""CNN Image Retrieval Learns from BoW: Unsupervised Fine-Tuning with Hard Examples"" by Radenović et al., both ECCV'16 papers). These works have shown that training for retrieval can be achieved with a siamese architectures and have demonstrated outstanding performance. As a result, many claims and findings of the paper are either outdated, questionable or just wrong.

Here are some of the misleading claims: 

  - ""Features aggregated from these feature maps have been exploited for image retrieval tasks and achieved state-of-the-art performances in recent years.""
  Until [a] (not cited), the state-of-the-art was still largely dominated by sparse invariant features based methods (see last Table in [a]).
  
  - ""the proposed method [...] outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on four typical datasets""
  That is not true, for the same reasons than above, and also because the state-of-the-art is now dominated by [a] and [b].
  
  - ""Also in situations where a large numbers of training samples are not available, instance retrieval using unsupervised method is still preferable and may be the only option."".
  This is a questionable opinion. The method exposed in ""End-to-end Learning of Deep Visual Representations for Image Retrieval"" by Gordo et al. outperforms the state-of-the-art on the UKB dataset (3.84 without QE or DBA) whereas it was trained for landmarks retrieval and not objects, i.e. in a different retrieval context. This demonstrates that in spite of insufficient training data, training is still possible and beneficial.

  - Finally, most findings are not even new or surprising (e.g. aggregate several regions in a multi-scale manner was already achieved by Tolias at al, etc.). So the interest of the paper is limited overall.

In addition, there are some problems in the experiments. For instance, the tuning experiments are only conducted on the Oxford dataset and using a single network (VGG-19), whereas it is not clear whether these conditions are well representative of all datasets and all networks (it is well known that the Oxford dataset behaves very differently than the Holidays dataset, for instance). In addition, tuning is performed very aggressively, making it look like the authors are tuning on the test set (e.g. see Table 3). 

To conclude, the paper is one year too late with respect to recent developments in the state of the art."

base,llama-3," 1 INTRODUCTION
One of the major catalysts for the resurgence of neural networks as “deep learning” was the influx of the availability of data. Labeled data is crucial for any supervised machine learning algorithm to work, even moreso for deep architectures which are easily susceptible to overfitting. Deep learning has flourished in a few domains (e.g. images, speech, text) where labeled data has been relatively simple to acquire. Unfortunately most of the data that is readily available is unstructured and unlabeled and this has prevented recent successes from propagating to other domains. In order to leverage the power of supervised learning, data must be manually labeled, a process which requires investment of human effort. An alternative to labeling unlabeled data is to generate new data with known labels. One variant of this approach is to create synthetic data from a simulation such as a computer graphics engine (Shotton et al., 2013; Richter et al., 2016), however, this may not work if the simulation is not a good representation of the real world domain. Another option is dataset augmentation, wherein the existing data is transformed in some way to create new data that appears to come from the same (conditional) data generating distribution (Bengio et al., 2011). The main challenge with such an approach is that domain expertise is required to ensure that the newly generated data respects valid transformations (i.e. those that would occur naturally in that domain).
In this work, we consider augmentation not by a domain-specific transformation, but by perturbing, interpolating, or extrapolating between existing examples. However, we choose to operate not in input space, but in a learned feature space. Bengio et al. (2013) and Ozair & Bengio (2014) claimed that higher level representations expand the relative volume of plausible data points within the feature space, conversely shrinking the space allocated for unlikely data points. As such, when traversing along the manifold it is more likely to encounter realistic samples in feature space than compared to input space. Unsupervised representation learning models offer a convenient way of learning useful feature spaces for exploring such transformations. Recently, there has been a return to interest in such techniques, leading to, e.g., variational autoencoders (Kingma & Welling, 2014), generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014), and generative stochastic networks (Alain et al., 2016), each of which could be used to generate useful"
base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel approach to transfer learning in reinforcement learning (RL) through a framework called A2T: Attend, Adapt, and Transfer. The framework aims to address two significant challenges in transfer learning: negative transfer and the selection of appropriate source tasks. The proposed architecture uses a deep attention network to selectively transfer knowledge from multiple source tasks to a target task, thereby avoiding negative transfer and improving learning efficiency.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses a critical issue in transfer learning, particularly in RL, by proposing a method to avoid negative transfer. This is a significant contribution as negative transfer can severely hinder the performance of RL agents.

2. **Selective Transfer Mechanism**: The use of a deep attention network to decide which source task solutions to apply in different parts of the state space is innovative. This selective transfer mechanism is well-motivated and aligns with real-world scenarios where different skills are applicable in different contexts.

3. **Comprehensive Framework**: A2T is presented as a generic framework that can be applied to various domains, such as robotics and gaming. This generality enhances the potential impact and applicability of the proposed method.

4. **Integration of Base Network**: The inclusion of a base network that learns from scratch in the target task is a thoughtful addition. It provides a fallback mechanism when source task solutions are not applicable, thus mitigating negative transfer.

5. **Empirical Validation**: The paper mentions empirical demonstrations of the effectiveness of A2T, which is crucial for validating the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Detailed Empirical Results**: While the paper claims empirical validation, it does not provide detailed results or comparisons with existing methods. This makes it difficult to assess the actual performance improvements and the conditions under which A2T excels or struggles.

2. **Complexity and Scalability**: The proposed architecture involves multiple components, including a deep attention network and a base network. The paper does not discuss the computational complexity or scalability of the approach, which could be a concern for large-scale applications.

3. **Assumptions on Source Tasks**: The framework assumes that source tasks are in the same domain as the target task, with the same state and action spaces. This assumption may limit the applicability of A2T in more diverse or complex environments where such alignment is not possible.

4. **Theoretical Justification**: While the paper provides a conceptual explanation of the approach, it lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of why and how"

base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents an intriguing exploration of how neural networks can be designed to mimic certain aspects of human visual perception, particularly focusing on the concept of ""defoveating autoencoders"" (DFAEs). The authors draw inspiration from the human visual system's ability to perceive high-detail information from low-fidelity inputs, proposing a framework to study this phenomenon using autoencoders. Here is a detailed review of the paper, highlighting its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Inspiration**: The paper introduces a novel concept by drawing parallels between human visual perception and neural network architectures. The idea of using a ""foveated"" input to mimic the human visual system's focus on high-detail regions is innovative and provides a fresh perspective on how neural networks can be designed.

2. **Clear Motivation**: The introduction effectively sets the stage by discussing the limitations of current deep learning models in processing visual information compared to the human visual system. The motivation to explore how networks can perceive from low-fidelity inputs is well-articulated.

3. **Framework Definition**: The paper clearly defines the framework of defoveating autoencoders, explaining the process of using a foveation function to create low-detail inputs and then reconstructing high-detail outputs. This clarity helps in understanding the proposed approach.

4. **Connection to Related Work**: The paper situates its contributions within the broader context of related work, including denoising autoencoders, image super-resolution, and attention mechanisms in deep learning. This helps in understanding the novelty and relevance of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Results**: The paper does not provide empirical results or experiments to validate the proposed framework. Without experimental evidence, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of DFAEs in practice.

2. **Limited Technical Details**: While the concept of DFAEs is introduced, the paper lacks detailed technical descriptions of the architecture, training process, and specific foveation functions used. This makes it challenging for readers to replicate or build upon the work.

human,human,"UPDATE: The authors addressed all my concerns in the new version of the paper, so I raised my score and now recommend acceptance.
--------------
This paper combines the recent progress in variational autoencoder and autoregressive density modeling in the proposed PixelVAE model. The paper shows that it can match the NLL performance of a PixelCNN with a PixelVAE that has a much shallower PixelCNN decoder.
I think the idea of capturing the global structure with a VAE and modeling the local structure with a PixelCNN decoder makes a lot of sense and can prevent the blurry reconstruction/samples of VAE. I specially like the hierarchical image generation experiments.

I have the following suggestions/concerns about the paper:

1) Is there any experiment showing that using the PixelCNN as the decoder of VAE will result in better disentangling of high-level factors of variations in the hidden code? For example, the authors can train a PixelVAE and VAE on MNIST with 2D hidden code and visualize the 2D hidden code for test images and color code each hidden code based on the digit and show that the digits have a better separation in the PixelVAE representation. A semi-supervised classification comparison between VAE and the PixelVAE will also significantly improve the quality of the paper.

2) A similar idea is also presented in a concurrent ICLR submission ""Variational Lossy Autoencoder"". It would be interesting to have a discussion included in the paper and compare these works.

3) The answer to the pre-review questions made the architecture details of the paper much more clear, but I still ask the authors to include the exact architecture details of all the experiments in the paper and/or open source the code. The clarity of the presentation is not satisfying and the experiments are difficult to reproduce.

4) As pointed out in my pre-review question, it would be great to include two sets of MNIST samples maybe in an appendix section. One with PixelCNN and the other with PixelVAE with the same pixelcnn depth to illustrate the hidden code in PixelVAE actually captures the global structure.

I will gladly raise the score if the authors address my concerns."
base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel approach to variational inference, termed ""wild variational inference,"" which aims to overcome the limitations of traditional variational inference methods that require tractable forms for the density of the approximating distribution. The authors propose two methods based on Stein's method and kernel techniques to enable the use of more complex inference networks without the need for tractability constraints on the output density.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The concept of ""wild variational inference"" is innovative, as it seeks to remove the constraints on the tractability of the output density, which is a significant limitation in traditional variational inference methods. This could potentially broaden the applicability of variational inference to more complex models.

2. **Use of Stein's Method**: The paper leverages Stein's method and kernel techniques, which are powerful tools in probabilistic modeling. These methods are well-suited for the task as they do not require the calculation of the proposal density, thus aligning with the paper's goal of removing tractability constraints.

3. **Practical Implications**: By allowing the use of arbitrary inference networks, the proposed methods could simplify the design and application of variational inference, making it more accessible to practitioners who may not have a strong background in the field.

4. **Adaptive Learning**: The paper discusses the potential for adaptive learning, where the inference network can improve its efficiency over time based on past tasks. This is a valuable feature for applications involving a large number of similar tasks.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Empirical Validation**: The paper does not provide empirical results or experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This is a significant omission, as empirical validation is crucial to assess the practical utility and performance of the methods.

2. **Complexity and Clarity**: The paper is dense and may be difficult to follow for readers who are not already familiar with the concepts of variational inference, Stein's method, and kernel techniques. The introduction of new terminology, such as ""wild variational inference,"" without clear definitions or examples, may add to the confusion.

3. **Comparison with Existing Methods**: While the paper mentions related work, it does not provide a detailed comparison of the proposed methods with existing approaches. A comparative analysis, including both theoretical and empirical aspects, would strengthen the paper by highlighting the advantages and potential limitations of the new methods.

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Approach**: The paper presents an innovative approach to understanding the optimal design of retinal sampling lattices by using a learnable model. This is a significant departure from traditional biological studies and offers a fresh perspective on the problem.

2. **Interdisciplinary Relevance**: By bridging concepts from biology (retinal sampling) and machine learning (neural networks and attention mechanisms), the paper appeals to a broad audience, including neuroscientists and AI researchers.

3. **Task-Oriented Analysis**: The focus on a visual search task to explore the retinal sampling lattice is well-chosen, as it is a common paradigm in both biological and artificial vision studies. This makes the findings relevant and potentially applicable to real-world scenarios.

4. **Exploration of Emergent Properties**: The paper investigates how different task constraints influence the emergence of an eccentricity-dependent sampling lattice. This exploration of emergent properties is a valuable contribution to understanding how neural networks can mimic biological systems.

5. **Technical Rigor**: The use of gradient descent optimization and differentiable models to learn the retinal sampling lattice is technically sound and aligns with current trends in machine learning research.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Quantitative Results**: The paper does not provide quantitative results or metrics to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. This makes it difficult to assess the performance and validity of the approach.

2. **Insufficient Biological Validation**: While the model is inspired by biological systems, there is a lack of direct comparison or validation against biological data. This weakens the claim that the model mimics the primate retina.

3. **Complexity and Clarity**: The paper is dense with technical details, which may be challenging for readers unfamiliar with both biological vision and neural network architectures. The explanation of the model, especially the mathematical formulation, could be clearer.

4. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the proposed approach, such as potential overfitting to artificial datasets or the generalizability of the findings to natural stimuli.

5. **Incomplete References**: Some references are incomplete or not properly cited, which can hinder readers from exploring related work and understanding the context of the study.

human,human,"*** Paper Summary ***

This paper applies adversarial and virtual adversarial training to LSTM for text classification. Since text inputs are discrete adversarial perturbation are applied to the (normalized) word embeddings. Extensive experiments are reported and demonstrate the advantage of these methods.

*** Review Summary ***

The paper reads well and has sufficent references. The application of adversarial training to text data is a simple but not trivial extension. The experimental section presents extensive experiments with comparison to alternative strategies. The proposed method is simple and effective and can be easily be applied after reading the paper.

*** Detailed Review ***

The paper reads well. I have only a few comments regarding experiments and link to prior resarch:

Experiments:

- In Table 2 (and for other datasets as well), could you include an SVM baseline? e.g. S Wang and C Manning 2012?
- As another baseline, did you consider dropping words, i.e. masking noise? It is generally better than dropout/gaussian noise for text application (e.g. denoising autoencoders)?
- I am not sure I understand why virtual adversarial is worse than the baseline in Table 5. If you tune epsilon, in the worse case you would get the same performance as the baseline? Was it that validation was unreliable?

Related Work:

I think it would be interesting to point at SVM, transductive SVM who achieve something similar to adversarial training. When maximizing the margin in a (transductive) SVM, it is equivalent to move the example toward the decision boundary, i.e. moving them in the direction of increase of the loss gradient.

Also it would be interesting to draw a parallel between adversarial training and contrastive divergence. The adversarial samples are very close in nature to the one step Markov Chain samples from CD. See Bengio 2009. Related to this technique are also approaches that try to explicitely cancel the Jacobian at data points, e.g. Rifai et al 2011.

#### Strengths

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The paper addresses a critical aspect of deep reinforcement learning (RL) that is often overlooked: computational efficiency. By focusing on the computational challenges and optimizations of deep RL, the paper contributes to a more practical understanding of how to implement these algorithms effectively in real-world scenarios.

2. **Comprehensive Background**: The introduction and related work sections provide a thorough overview of the evolution of deep RL, from the foundational concepts to the latest advancements. This sets a solid context for the reader and highlights the significance of the computational challenges being addressed.

3. **Technical Depth**: The paper delves into the specifics of the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm, explaining both the theoretical underpinnings and the practical implementation details. This dual focus is beneficial for readers who are interested in both the algorithmic and system-level aspects of deep RL.

4. **Empirical Evaluation**: The implementation of both CPU and GPU versions of A3C in TensorFlow and the subsequent performance analysis provide valuable insights into the trade-offs and benefits of different computational strategies. The reported speedups (up to 6× for small DNNs and 45× for larger DNNs) are impressive and demonstrate the potential of the proposed optimizations.

5. **Contribution to the Field**: By focusing on the computational aspects and proposing a hybrid CPU/GPU implementation (GA3C), the paper offers practical guidance for researchers and developers aiming to improve the efficiency of deep RL systems.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Novelty in Algorithmic Approach**: While the paper provides a detailed analysis of computational optimizations, it does not introduce any novel algorithmic contributions to the field of RL. The focus is primarily on implementation and system-level improvements.

2. **Limited Scope of Evaluation**: The empirical evaluation is primarily focused on the Atari 2600 environment. While this is a standard benchmark in RL research, it would be beneficial to see how the proposed optimizations perform in other environments or tasks to demonstrate broader applicability.

3. **Incomplete Explanation of Results**: The paper mentions significant speedups in training but does not provide a detailed breakdown of where these improvements come from. A more granular analysis of the factors contributing to the speedup (e.g., data transfer optimizations, parallelism strategies) would enhance the understanding of the results.

human,human,"While the overall direction is promising, there are several serious issues with the paper which affect the novelty and validity of the results:

1. Incorrect claims about related work affecting novelty:

  - This work is not the first to explore a deep learning approach to automatic code completion: “Toward Deep Learning Software Repositories”, MSR’15 also uses deep learning for code completion, and is not cited.

  - “Code Completion with Statistical Language Models”, PLDI’14 is cited incorrectly -- it also does code completion with recurrent neural networks.

  - PHOG is independent of JavaScript -- it does representation learning and has been applied to other languages (e.g., Python, see OOPSLA’16 below). 

  - This submission is not the only one that “can automatically extract features”. Some high-precision (cited) baselines do it.

  - “Structured generative models of natural source code” is an incorrect citation. It is from ICML’14 and has more authors. It is also a log-linear model and conditions on more context than claimed in this submission.


2. Uses a non-comparable prediction task for non-terminal symbols: The type of prediction made here is simpler than the one used in PHOG and state-of-the-art (see OOPSLA’16 paper below) and thus the claimed 11 point improvement is not substantiated. In particular, in JavaScript there are 44 types of nodes. However, a PHOG and OOPSLA’16 predictions considers not only these 44 types, but also whether there are right siblings and children of a node. This is necessary for predicting tree fragments instead of a sequence of nodes. It however makes the prediction harder than the one considered here (it leads to 150+ labels, a >3x increase).


3. Not comparing to state-of-the-art: the state-of-the-art however is not the basic PHOG cited here, but “Probabilistic Model for Code with Decision Trees”, (OOPSLA 2016) which appeared before the submission deadline for ICLR’17:

human,human,"The bulk of the reviewer (R) comments pertain to the experiments on MNIST that we address collectively here to facilitate a richer, holistic discussion. Any remaining questions raised by the reviewers are addressed individually as follow-ups to the reviews.

We have rewritten the entire experimental section based on fresh experimentation, focusing on aspects that we believe are crucial to resolving the concerns raised by the reviewers. For brevity, we have also removed some portions from the earlier draft that we do not believe are central to the discussion. In the spirit of the constructive feedback loop that ICLR facilitates, we hope the reviewers will be able to read the revised experiments section. Our response to the reviewer comments:

1. A bigger VAE vs. BGMs containing smaller models (R1)
Our earlier submission demonstrated improved performance of BGMs for sampling with gains in computational requirements, but did not directly address the reviewer’s question about model capacity. Our latest submission considers larger baseline models with equal or more capacity than BGM sequences of simpler models (Sec. 3.2.2, Table 2), and shows the superior performance of BGMs for this task (Figure 3) . As before, we also illustrate that the performance gains of BGM sequences are not at the cost of increased training time (Sec 3.2.3, Table 2).

2. Samples from MNIST look weak (R4)
Our experiments on MNIST do not (or even intended to) make any state-of-the-art claims, but instead demonstrate the improvements in computational and statistical performance that simpler models can attain for the task of generating samples as a result of the boosting procedure. Having said that, we respectfully disagree that the samples produced by BGM sequences look weak keeping in mind that the dataset under consideration is the harder ‘binarized’ version of MNIST. In fact, although we understand that it is somewhat subjective, we believe the BGM samples look better than NADE samples on the same dataset (Figure 2 (Left) in [2]). Note that we display actual samples produced by our models (without any cherry-picking), and hence, these samples should not be compared with the probabilities from sampling pixels (Figure 2 (Middle) in [2]). 

3. Strategies for setting weights (\alpha’s) for intermediate models (R3)
In our earlier submission, we discussed model weights in the theoretical section and listed heuristic strategies for setting them in practice as a future work. Our latest submission includes experimental results and discussion of some heuristic strategies that we propose for both density estimation and sampling. See Sec. 3.1.3 and Appendix A.2.1.

4. Procedure for drawing samples from BGM sequences (R1, R3)
See Appendix A.2.3 for details.  In contrast to results in the previous submission where the independent chains were run from the same start seeds across BGM sequences and samples arranged for easy comparison, the latest results show samples produced from chains that are run independently, initialized with different random start seeds, and have an increased burn-in time of 100,000 samples (10x the previous) to mitigate the possibility of any mixing-related issues. We also observed visually that the samples from any given chain vary over time transforming smoothly across multiple digits within the burn-in time, a further indication of successful mixing. 

5. Quantitative estimation of log-likelihoods for sampling (R1, R3, R4)
For evaluating samples, log-likelihoods can be problematic. See [1], Sec. 3.2 for a detailed discussion on why log-likelihoods are not a good proxy for sample quality. Additionally, generative models such as VAEs, RBMs have intractable likelihoods and hence, resort to their own approximations for generating density estimates. These approximations are known to exhibit different behaviors; for instance, RBMs estimated using AIS are typically believed to overestimate the log-likelihoods, whereas VAEs make variational approximations that only provide lower bounds -- it is difficult to make definitive statements based on such approximations. We tried AIS on the BGM sequences considered in the paper with about 15,000 intermediate annealing distributions (step-size of 1e-3 between for the first 500 distributions, 1e-4 for the next 4000, and 1e-5 for the remaining where every transition from one distribution to another was implemented using 10 steps of Metropolis-Hastings), but got unrealistically optimistic log-likelihood evaluations that we do not feel confident reporting for the purpose of a meaningful comparison with the lower bounds provided by VAEs.

base,gpt-4o,"**Review of the Paper on Acoustic Communication and Bioacoustic Signal Segmentation**

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Novelty:** The paper addresses a significant problem in bioacoustics, which is the automatic segmentation and identification of song units in non-human acoustic signals. This is a relevant and timely topic given the increasing interest in understanding animal communication and the challenges associated with manual segmentation.

2. **Methodological Approach:** The use of Bayesian non-parametric models, specifically the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM), is a strong methodological choice. This approach allows for the automatic inference of the number of states, which is a critical advantage over traditional HMMs that require pre-specification of the number of states.

3. **Application to Real-World Data:** The paper applies the proposed method to real-world bioacoustic data, including humpback whale songs and multi-species bird songs. This demonstrates the practical applicability of the approach and its potential to handle complex and diverse datasets.

4. **Comprehensive Feature Extraction:** The use of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for feature extraction is appropriate and well-justified, as these features are widely used in audio processing and provide a compact representation of the sound spectrum.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Experimental Results:** The paper lacks detailed experimental results and quantitative evaluations of the proposed method. There is no clear presentation of how the HDP-HMM performs compared to other methods, such as traditional HMMs or clustering approaches like K-means.

2. **Insufficient Discussion on Limitations:** While the paper mentions the limitations of standard HDP-HMMs, such as inadequate modeling of temporal persistence, it does not provide a thorough discussion on how these limitations impact the results or how they are addressed in the current study.

3. **Clarity and Structure:** The paper could benefit from improved clarity and organization. Some sections, particularly the introduction and related work, are dense and could be better structured to enhance readability. Additionally, the transition between sections is sometimes abrupt, making it difficult to follow the flow of the paper.

4. **Lack of Visual Aids:** The paper would benefit from the inclusion of visual aids, such as diagrams or figures, to illustrate the HDP-HMM model, the feature extraction process, and the segmentation results. This would help readers better understand the methodology and its application.

5. **Limited Discussion on Biological Implications:** While the paper"

base,gpt-4o,"### Review of the Paper

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Contribution**: The paper proposes a unified framework for robust Kernel PCA (KPCA) and pre-image estimation without a pre-training stage. This is a significant contribution as it addresses the limitations of existing non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques in solving ill-posed problems.

2. **Theoretical Insights**: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for using trace norm regularization in the feature space, which is a novel approach to handle the implicitness of the feature space in non-linear dimensionality reduction.

3. **Practical Relevance**: The proposed method is shown to outperform state-of-the-art techniques in missing data prediction and non-rigid structure from motion (NRSfM), demonstrating its practical applicability.

4. **Generalizability**: The framework is presented as being easily generalizable to incorporate other cost functions, which could make it applicable to a wide range of ill-posed inference problems.

5. **Clarity in Problem Formulation**: The problem is clearly formulated, and the paper provides a good overview of the challenges associated with non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Details**: While the paper claims state-of-the-art results, it lacks detailed experimental results and comparisons with existing methods. More comprehensive experiments with various datasets would strengthen the claims.

2. **Complexity and Scalability**: The paper does not discuss the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm or its scalability to large datasets, which is crucial for practical applications.

3. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The paper does not clearly outline the assumptions and limitations of the proposed method. For instance, the impact of the choice of kernel function on the performance is not discussed.

4. **Literature Review**: The literature review is somewhat limited and could be expanded to include more recent advancements in non-linear dimensionality reduction and related fields.

5. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper could benefit from improved clarity and structure. Some sections, particularly the introduction, are dense and could be better organized to enhance readability.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

human,human,"Summary: The paper proposes a large-scale dataset for reading comprehension, with the final goal of releasing 1 million questions and answers. The authors have currently released 100,000 queries and their answers. The dataset differs from existing reading comprehension datasets mainly w.r.t queries being sampled from user queries rather than being generated by crowd-workers and answers being generated by crowd-workers rather than being spans of text from the provided passage. The paper presents some analysis of the dataset such as distribution of answer types. The paper also presents the results of some generative and some cloze-style models on the MS MARCO dataset.

Strengths:

1. The paper provides useful insights about the limitations of the existing reading comprehension datasets – questions asked by crowd-workers have different distribution compared to that of questions asked by actual users of intelligent agents, answers being restricted to span from the reading text rather than requiring reasoning across multiple pieces of text/passages.

2. MS MARCO dataset has novel useful characteristics compared to existing reading comprehension datasets – questions are sampled from user queries, answers are generated by humans.

3. The experimental evaluation of the existing baseline models on the MS MARCO dataset is satisfactory.

Weaknesses/Suggestions:

1. The paper does not report human performance on the dataset. Human performance should be reported to estimate the difficulty of the dataset. The degree of inter-human agreement will also reflect how well the metric (being used to compute inter-human agreement and accuracies of the baseline models) can deal with variance in the sentence structure with similar semantics.

2. I would like to see the comparison between the answer type distribution in the MS MARCO dataset and that in existing reading comprehension datasets such as SQuAD. This would ground the claim made in the paper the distributions of questions asked by crowd-workers is different from that of user queries.

3. The paper uses automatic metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU for evaluating natural language answers. However, it is known that such metrics poorly correlate with human judgement for tasks such as image caption evaluation (Chen et al., Microsoft COCO Captions: Data Collection and Evaluation Server, CoRR abs/1504.00325 (2015)). So, I wonder how authors justify using such metrics for evaluating open-ended natural language answers.

4. The paper mentions that a classifier was used to filter answer seeking queries from all Bing queries. It would be good to mention the accuracy of this classifier. This will provide insights into what percentage of the MS MARCO questions are answer seeking queries. Similarly, what is the accuracy of the information retrieval based system used to retrieve passages for filtered queries?

5. Please include the description of the best passage baseline in the paper.
  
6. Fix opening quotes, i.e. ” -> “ (for instance, on page 5, ”what” -> “what”).

Review Summary: The paper is well motivated, the use of user queries and human generated answers makes the dataset different from existing datasets. However, I would like to see the human performance on the dataset and quantitative comparison between the distribution of questions obtained from user queries and that of crowd-sourced questions. I would also like the authors to comment on the use of automatic metrics (such as ROUGE, BLEU) in the light of the fact that such metrics do not correlate well with human judgements for tasks such as image caption evaluation."
base,gpt-4o,"### Review of the Paper

#### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Contribution**: The paper introduces a novel approach, TBuckets, for evaluating the coherence of topics generated by topic models. This approach is innovative in its use of thematic grouping (buckets) to assess topic coherence, which is a fresh perspective compared to traditional methods.

2. **Methodological Rigor**: The paper outlines three distinct techniques for creating buckets: clustering-based, SVD, and SVD with reorganization. This variety allows for a comprehensive exploration of the TBuckets approach and provides multiple avenues for potential improvements in topic coherence evaluation.

3. **Parameter-Free Approach**: The SVD-based techniques are highlighted as being completely parameter-free, which is a significant advantage. This reduces the complexity and potential biases introduced by parameter tuning, making the approach more robust and easier to apply across different datasets.

4. **Empirical Evaluation**: The paper includes an empirical evaluation that correlates the TBuckets coherence scores with human-annotated scores. This validation step is crucial for demonstrating the practical utility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

5. **Comparison with State-of-the-Art**: By comparing the TBuckets approach with state-of-the-art results, the paper provides a clear benchmark for its performance, which is essential for establishing its contribution to the field.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Detailed Explanation**: While the paper introduces the TBuckets approach, it lacks detailed explanations of the clustering-based and SVD techniques. More information on how these methods are implemented and how they specifically contribute to the creation of buckets would be beneficial.

2. **Limited Experimental Details**: The paper does not provide sufficient details about the datasets used for evaluation, the specific metrics for coherence, or the experimental setup. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the reproducibility and generalizability of the results.

3. **Human Annotation Process**: The process of obtaining human-annotated scores is not described in detail. Information on the number of annotators, their expertise, and the criteria used for annotation would strengthen the validity of the empirical evaluation.

4. **Potential Overemphasis on Coherence**: While coherence is an important aspect of topic quality, the paper could benefit from discussing other dimensions of topic quality, such as diversity or relevance, and how TBuckets might address or complement these aspects.

5. **Limited Discussion on Related Work**: The related work section is brief and could be expanded to include a more comprehensive review of existing methods for topic coherence"

human,human,"This paper develops a differentiable interpreter for the Forth programming
language. This enables writing a program ""sketch"" (a program with parts left
out), with a hole to be filled in based upon learning from input-output
examples. The main technical development is to start with an abstract machine
for the Forth language, and then to make all of the operations differentiable.
The technique for making operations differentiable is analogous to what is done
in models like Neural Turing Machine and Stack RNN. Special syntax is developed
for specifying holes, which gives the pattern about what data should be read
when filling in the hole, which data should be written, and what the rough
structure of the model that fills the hole should be. Motivation for why one
should want to do this is that it enables composing program sketches with other
differentiable models like standard neural networks, but the experiments focus
on sorting and addition tasks with relatively small degrees of freedom for how
to fill in the holes.

Experimentally, result show that sorting and addition can be learned given
strong sketches.

The aim of this paper is very ambitious: convert a full programming language to
be differentiable, and I admire this ambition. The idea is provocative and I
think will inspire people in the ICLR community.

The main weakness is that the experiments are somewhat trivial and there are no
baselines. I believe that simply enumerating possible values to fill in the
holes would work better, and if that is possible, then it's not clear to me what
is practically gained from this formulation. (The authors argue that the point
is to compose differentiable Forth sketches with neural networks sitting below,
but if the holes can be filled by brute force, then could the underlying neural
network not be separately trained to maximize the probability assigned to any
filling of the hole that produces the correct input-output behavior?)

Related, one thing that is missing, in my opinion, is a more nuanced outlook of
where the authors believe this work is going. Based on the small scale of the
experiments and from reading other related papers in the area, I sense that it
is hard to scale up differentiable forth to large real-world problems. It
would be nice to have more discussion about this, and perhaps even an experiment
that demonstrates a failure case. Is there a problem that is somewhat more
complex than the ones that appear in the paper where the approach does not work?
What has been tried to make it work? What are the failure modes? What are the
challenges that the authors believe need to be overcome to make this work.

Overall, I think this paper deserves consideration for being provocative.
However, I'm hesitant to strongly recommend acceptance because the experiments
are weak."
base,gpt-4o,"### Review of the Paper

#### Strengths

1. **Relevance and Importance**: The paper addresses a significant problem in the field of deep learning, particularly in the context of deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices. The focus on pruning to reduce inference time and resource usage is highly relevant given the increasing demand for efficient AI models.

2. **Comprehensive Background**: The introduction provides a thorough overview of existing methods for neural network pruning, including both historical approaches and more recent developments. This sets a solid foundation for understanding the context and motivation behind the proposed method.

3. **Clear Methodology**: The paper outlines a clear and straightforward methodology for pruning CNNs, which involves alternating between pruning and fine-tuning. This iterative approach is well-explained and easy to follow.

4. **Novelty in Pruning Criteria**: The introduction of several pruning criteria, including a new criterion based on the Taylor expansion, adds novelty to the work. The exploration of different criteria for evaluating parameter importance is a valuable contribution.

5. **Focus on Practicality**: The emphasis on computational efficiency and the avoidance of complex computations like the Hessian matrix is a practical consideration that enhances the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Results**: The paper does not provide any experimental results or empirical validation of the proposed method. This is a significant omission, as it is crucial to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the pruning approach through experiments on benchmark datasets and models.

2. **Limited Discussion on Trade-offs**: While the paper mentions the trade-off between accuracy and pruning objectives (e.g., FLOPs, memory utilization), it lacks a detailed discussion on how these trade-offs are managed and the impact on model performance.

3. **Insufficient Detail on Pruning Criteria**: Although several pruning criteria are mentioned, the paper does not delve deeply into how these criteria are computed or their relative advantages and disadvantages. More detailed explanations and comparisons would strengthen the paper.

4. **Oracle Pruning Feasibility**: The discussion on oracle pruning is somewhat theoretical, as it is acknowledged to be prohibitively costly. The paper could benefit from a more practical perspective on how close the proposed criteria can get to the oracle's performance.

human,human,"- summary

The paper proposes a differntiable Neural Physics Engine (NPE). The NPE consists of an encoder and a decoder function. The NPE takes as input the state of pairs of objects (within a neighbourhood of a focus object) at two previous time-steps in a scene. The encoder function summarizes the interaction of each pair of objects. The decoder then outputs the change in velocity of the focus object at the next time step. The NPE is evaluated on various environments containing bouncing balls.

- novelty

The differentiable NPE is a novel concept. However, concurrently Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) proposes a very similar model. Just as this work, Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) consider a model which consists of a encoder function (relation-centric) which encodes the interaction among a focus object and other objects in the scene and a decoder (relation-centric) function which considers the cumulative (encoded) effect of object interactions on the focus object and predicts effect of the interactions.  Aspects like only considering objects interactions within a neighbourhood (versus the complete object interaction graph in Battaglia et al.) based on euclideian distance  are novel to this work. However, the advantages (if any) of NPE versus the model of Battaglia et al. are not clear. Moreover, it is not clear how this neighbourhood thresholding scene would preform in case of n-ball systems, where gravitational forces of massive objects can be felt over large distances.

- citations 

This work includes all relevant citations.

- clarity

The article is well written and easy to understand.

- experiments 

Battaglia et al. evaluates on wider variety senerios compared to this work (e.g. n-bodies under gravitation, falling strings). Such experiments demonstrate the ability of the models to generalize. However, this work does include more in-depth experiments in case of bouncing balls compared to Battaglia et al. (e.g. mass estimation and varying world configurations with obstacles in the bouncing balls senerio). 

Moreover, an extensive comparison to Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) (in the bouncing balls senerios) is missing. The authors (referring to answer to question 4) do point out to comaprable numbers in both works, but the experimental settings are different.  Comparison in a billiard table senerio like that Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) where a initial force is applied to a ball, would have been enlightening. 

The authors only evaluate the error in velocity in the bouncing balls senerios. We understand that this model predicts only the velocity (refer to answer of question 2). Error analysis also with respect to ground truth ball position would be more enlightening. As small errors in velocity can quickly lead to entirely different scene configuration.

- conclusion / recommendation

The main issue with this work is the unclear novelty with respect to work of Battaglia et al. at NIPS'16. A quantitative and qualitative comparison with Battaglia et al. is lacking.  But the authors state that their work was developed independently.

Differentiable physics engines like NPE or that of Battaglia et al. (NIPS 2016) requires generation of an extensive amount of synthetic data to learn about the physics of a certain senerio. Moreover, extensive retraining is required to adapt to new sceneries (e.g. bouncing balls to n-body systems). Any practical advantage versus generating new code for a physics engine is not clear. Other ""bottom-up"" approaches like that of  Fragkiadaki et al. (2015) couple vision along with learning dynamics. However, they require very few input parameters (position, mass, current velocity, world configuration), as approximate parameter estimation can be done from the visual component.  Such approaches could be potentially more useful of a robot in ""common-sense"" everyday tasks (e.g. manipulation). Thus, overall potential applications of a differentiable physics engine like NPE is unclear."
human,human,"In this paper a well known soft mixture of experts model is adapted for, and applied to, a specific type of transfer learning problem in reinforcement learning (RL), namely transfer of action policies and value functions between similar tasks. Although not treated as such, the experimental setup is reminiscent of hierarchical RL works, an aspect which the paper does not consider at length, regrettably.
One possible implication of this work is that architecture and even learning algorithm choices could simply be stated in terms of the objective of the target task, rather than being hand-engineered by the experimenter. This is clearly an interesting direction of future work which the paper illuminates.


Pros:
The paper diligently explains how the network architecture fits in with various widely used reinforcement learning setups, which does facilitate continuation of this work.
The experiments are good proofs of concept, but do not go beyond that i.m.h.o. 
Even so, this work provides convincing clues that collections of deep networks, which were trained on not entirely different tasks, generalize better to related tasks when used together rather than through conventional transfer learning (e.g. fine-tuning).

Cons:
As the paper well recounts in the related work section, libraries of fixed policies have long been formally proposed for reuse while learning similar tasks. Indeed, it is well understood in hierarchical RL literature that it can be beneficial to reuse libraries of fixed (Fernandez & Veloso 2006) or jointly learned policies which may not apply to the entire state space, e.g. options (Pricop et. al). What is not well understood is how to build such libraries, and this paper does not convincingly shed light in that direction, as far as I can tell.
The transfer tasks have been picked to effectively illustrate the potential of the proposed architecture, but the paper does not tackle negative transfer or compositional reuse in well known challenging situations outlined in previous work (e.g. Parisotto et. al 2015, Rusu el. al 2015, 2016).
Since the main contributions are of an empirical nature, I am curious how the results shown in figures 6 & 7 look plotted against wall-clock time, since relatively low data efficiency is not a limitation for achieving perfect play in Pong (see Mnih. et al, 2015). It would be more illuminating to consider tasks where final performance is plausibly limited by data availability. It would also be interesting if the presented results were achieved with reduced amounts of computation, or reduced representation sizes compared to learning from scratch, especially when one of the useful source tasks is an actual policy trained on the target task.
Finally, it is perhaps underwhelming that it takes a quarter of the data required for learning Pong from scratch just to figure out that a perfect Pong policy is already in the expert library. Simply evaluating each expert for 10 episodes and using an  average-score-weighted majority vote to mix action choices would probably achieve the same final performance for a smaller fraction of the data.

base,gpt-4o,"### Review of the Paper

#### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Inspiration**: The paper introduces a novel concept of ""defoveating autoencoders"" (DFAE), inspired by the human visual system's ability to perceive high-detail information from low-fidelity inputs. This is an interesting and innovative approach that leverages biological insights to inform artificial neural network design.

2. **Clear Motivation**: The introduction effectively sets the stage by contrasting the human visual system's efficiency with the current limitations of deep learning models. The motivation to explore how neural networks can learn from low-detail inputs is well-articulated.

3. **Comprehensive Related Work**: The related work section is thorough, covering various areas such as denoising autoencoders, image super-resolution, and attention mechanisms in deep learning. This situates the research within the broader context of existing studies and highlights its unique focus.

4. **Framework Explanation**: The paper provides a clear explanation of the DFAE framework, detailing how it differs from traditional autoencoders and the specific scientific questions it aims to address. The use of generative models to study perception is a thoughtful approach.

5. **Potential for Future Work**: The paper hints at future extensions, such as incorporating attention mechanisms into the DFAE framework, which could lead to further advancements and applications.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Results**: The paper does not provide any experimental results or empirical validation of the proposed DFAE framework. This makes it difficult to assess the practical effectiveness and performance of the approach.

2. **Limited Technical Details**: While the conceptual framework is well-explained, there is a lack of technical details regarding the implementation of DFAEs. For instance, specifics about the architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are missing.

3. **Ambiguity in Perception Measurement**: The paper mentions measuring the similarity between original and generated images as a proxy for perception but does not specify the metrics or methods used for this evaluation. This leaves a gap in understanding how perception is quantitatively assessed.

4. **Overemphasis on Biological Analogy**: While the biological inspiration is compelling, the paper could benefit from a more balanced discussion that also considers the limitations and differences between biological and artificial systems.

5. **Scope of Application**: The paper focuses on a specific scientific question but does not explore potential applications or implications of DFAEs in real-world scenarios, such as image processing or computer vision tasks.

#### Suggestions for Improvement

base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel approach to semi-supervised learning by integrating graph-based techniques with neural network training. The authors propose a discriminative training objective that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data, inspired by label propagation, and can be efficiently trained using stochastic gradient descent. The paper's contributions include a regularization term for neural networks that enforces similarity between nodes in graphs, and the use of graphs as direct inputs to train neural network classifiers.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a unique method that combines the strengths of graph-based label propagation with neural network training. This integration is a promising direction for improving semi-supervised learning, especially in scenarios where relational data is available.

2. **Scalability**: The proposed method is designed to be scalable, which is crucial for handling large datasets. The use of stochastic gradient descent for training ensures that the approach can be applied to large graphs efficiently.

3. **Flexibility**: The framework is flexible, allowing for the combination of multiple graphs from different domains. This adaptability is a significant advantage over more rigid methods.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The paper claims to provide extensive experiments demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method compared to previous approaches. This empirical evidence is essential for validating the theoretical contributions.

5. **Clear Motivation**: The introduction clearly outlines the motivation for the work, highlighting the limitations of existing semi-supervised learning methods and the potential benefits of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Detailed Experiments**: While the paper mentions extensive experiments, the provided text does not include specific details about the experimental setup, datasets used, or quantitative results. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the empirical validity of the claims.

2. **Complexity and Implementation**: The proposed method involves several components, including graph construction, neural network training, and the integration of these elements. The paper does not provide sufficient details on the implementation, which could be a barrier for practitioners looking to apply this method.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper briefly mentions related work but does not provide a thorough comparative analysis with existing methods. A more detailed comparison, including strengths and weaknesses relative to other approaches, would strengthen the paper.

4. **Theoretical Justification**: While the paper introduces a novel objective function, it lacks a rigorous theoretical analysis of why this approach should work better than existing methods. Providing theoretical insights or guarantees would enhance the contribution.

5. **Clarity and Structure**: The paper"
human,human,"This paper introduces CoopNets, an algorithm which trains a Deep-Energy Model (DEM, the “descriptor”) with the help of an auxiliary directed bayes net, e.g. “the generator”. The descriptor is trained via standard maximum likelihood, with Langevin MCMC for sampling. The generator is trained to generate likely samples under the DEM in a single, feed-forward ancestral sampling step. It can thus be used to shortcut expensive MCMC sampling, hence the reference to “cooperative training”.

The above idea is interesting and novel, but unfortunately is not sufficiently validated by the experimental results. First and foremost, two out of the three experiments do not feature a train /test split, and ignore standard training and evaluation protocols for texture generation (see [R1]). Datasets are also much too small. As such these experiments only seem to confirm the ability of the model to overfit. On the third in-painting tasks, baselines are almost non-existent: no VAEs, RBMs, DEM, etc which makes it difficult to evaluate the benefits of the proposed approach.

In a future revision, I would also encourage the authors to answer the following questions experimentally. What is the impact of the missing rejection step in Langevin MCMC (train with, without ?). What is the impact of the generator on the burn-in process of the Markov chain (show sample auto-correlation). How bad is approximation of training the generator from ({\tilde{Y}, \hat{X}) instead of ({\tilde{Y}, \tilde{X}) ? Run comparative experiments.

The paper would also greatly benefit from a rewrite focusing on clarity, instead of hyperbole (“pioneering work” in reference to closely related, but non-peer reviewed work) and prose (“tale of two nets”). For example, the authors fail to specify the exact form of the energy function: this seems like a glaring omission.

PROS:
+ Interesting and novel idea
CONS:
- Improper experimental protocols
- Missing baselines
- Missing diagnostic experiments

human,human,"This paper investigates the  modeling of graph sequences . Authors propose Graph Convolutional Recurrent Networks (GRCN)  that extends convLSTM  (Shi et al. 2015) for data having an unregular graph structure at each timestep. They replace the 2D convolution with a graph convolutional operator from (Defferrad et al., 2016).
Authors propose two variations of the GRCN model. In Model 1,  the graph convolution is only applied on the input data. In Model 2, the graph convolution  is applied on both  input data and the previous hidden states. They evaluate their approaches on two different tasks, video generation using the movingMNIST dataset and world-level language modelling using Penntreebank.

On movingMNIST authors show that their GRCN 2 improves upon convLSTM. However, they evaluate only with one-layer convLSTM, while Shi et al. report better results with 3 layers (also not as good as  GRCN) . It would be nice to evaluate GCRCN in that setting as well.
While the authors show an improvement of GRCN relatively to convLSTM, GRCN on this task seems relatively weak compared to recent works such as the Video Pixel Networks (Kalchbrenner et al., 2016). It contradicts the claim that ""Model 2 has shown good performance in the case of video prediction"" in the conclusion.

For the Penntreebank experiments, author compares  their model 1 with FC-LSTM, with or without dropout. However, the results in (Zaremba et al., 2014) still seems different than the one reported here. In (Zaremba et al., 2014), they  reports a test perplexity of 78.4 for the large regularized LSTM in their table 1 which outperforms the score of the GRCN. Also, following works such as variational dropout or zoneout have since improve upon Zaremba results. Is there some differences in the experimental setting?  It would be nice to have results that are directly comparable to previous work.


Pros:
- Interesting model, 
Cons:
- Overall, the proposed contribution is relatively incremental compared to (Shi et al. 2015) and (Defferrad et al., 2016). 
- Weak results of GRCN relatively to previous works in the experiments, that do not convince of the GRCN advantages.

base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents an innovative approach to neural memory systems by introducing Lie-access neural Turing machines (LANTM), which utilize Lie groups for memory access. This approach aims to address limitations in existing neural memory systems, particularly concerning differentiability and robust relative indexing. Below is a detailed review of the paper, highlighting its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Innovation**: The paper introduces a novel concept of using Lie groups for memory access in neural networks. This is a creative approach that leverages mathematical structures to potentially improve memory access mechanisms in neural networks.

2. **Clear Motivation**: The authors clearly articulate the limitations of existing neural memory systems, such as the lack of robust relative indexing and differentiability issues. This sets a strong foundation for the proposed solution.

3. **Theoretical Foundation**: The use of Lie groups is well-motivated theoretically. The properties of Lie groups, such as differentiability, identity, invertibility, and associativity, are well-aligned with the desired properties of neural memory systems.

4. **Experimental Results**: The paper provides experimental results demonstrating that LANTM can learn non-trivial algorithmic tasks with higher accuracy than traditional memory-based approaches. This empirical evidence supports the effectiveness of the proposed method.

5. **Comprehensive Background**: The paper provides a thorough background on recurrent neural networks and existing memory systems, which helps in understanding the context and significance of the proposed approach.

### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity and Accessibility**: The introduction of Lie groups and their application to neural memory systems may be complex for readers not familiar with advanced mathematical concepts. The paper could benefit from more intuitive explanations or visualizations to make the content more accessible.

2. **Limited Experimental Scope**: While the paper presents some experimental results, the scope of the experiments is not very broad. It would be beneficial to see the performance of LANTM on a wider range of tasks and datasets to better understand its generalizability and robustness.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: The paper lacks a detailed comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art memory systems. A more comprehensive comparison, including quantitative metrics and qualitative insights, would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method.

4. **Implementation Details**: The paper could provide more detailed implementation specifics, such as hyperparameters, training procedures, and computational resources used. This would aid in reproducibility and allow other researchers to build upon this work.

human,human,"Summary
===
This paper presents tic-tac-toe as toy problem for investigating CNNs.
A dataset is created containing tic-tac-toe boards where one player is one
move away from winning and a CNN is trained to label boards according
to (1) the player who can win (2 choices) and (2) the position they may move
to win (9 choices), resulting in 18 labels. The CNN evaluated in this paper
performs perfectly at the task and the paper's goal is to inspect how the
CNN works.

The fundamental mechanism for this inspection is Class Activation
Mapping (CAM) (Zhou et. al. 2016), which identifies regions of implicit attention
in the CNN. These implicit attention maps (localization heat maps) are used to
derive actions (which square each player should move). The attention maps  

(1) attend to squares in the tic-tac-toe board rather than arbitrary
blobs, despite the fact that one square in a board has uniform color, and

(2) they can be used to pick correct (winning) actions.

This experiment are used to support assertions that the network understands
(1) chess (tic-tac-toe) boards
(2) a rule for winning tic-tac-toe
(3) that there are two players.

Some follow up experiments indicate similar results under various renderings
of the tic-tac-toe boards and an incomplete training regime.


More Clarifying Questions
===

* I am not quite sure precisely how CAM is implemented here. In the original CAM
one must identify a class of interest to visualize (e.g., cat or dog). I don't
think this paper identifies such a choice. How is one of the 18 possible classes
chosen for creating the CAM visualization and through that visualization
choosing an action?

* How was the test set for this dataset for the table 1 results created?
How many of the final 1029 states were used for test and was the
distribution of labels the same in train and test?

* How is RCO computed? Is rank correlation or Pearson correlation used?
If Pearson correlation is used then it may be good to consider rank correlation,
as argued in ""Human Attention in Visual Question Answering: Do Humans and
Deep Networks Look at the Same Regions?"" by Das et. al. in EMNLP 2016.
In table 1, what does the 10^3 next to RCO mean?


Pros
===

* The proposed method, deriving an action to take from the result of a
visualization technique, is very novel.

* This paper provides an experiment that clearly shows a CNN relying on context
to make accurate predictions.

* The use of a toy tic-tac-toe domain to study attention in CNNs
(implicit or otherwise) is a potentially fruitful setting that may
lead to better understanding of implicit and maybe explicit attention mechanisms.


Cons
===

* This work distinguishes between predictions about ""what will happen""
(will the white player win?) and ""what to do"" (where should the white
player move to win?). The central idea is generalization from ""what will happen""
to ""what to do"" indicates concept learning (sec. 2.1). Why should an ability to
act be any more indicative of a learned concept than an ability to predict
future states. I see a further issue with the presentation of this approach and
a potential correctness problem:

1. (correctness)
In the specific setting proposed I see no difference between ""what to do""
and ""what will happen.""

Suppose one created labels dictating ""what to do"" for each example in the
proposed dataset. How would these differ from the labels of ""what will happen""
in the proposed dataset? In this case ""what will happen"" labels include
both player identity (who wins) and board position (which position they move
to win). Wouldn't the ""what to do"" labels need to indicate board position?
They could also chosen to indicate player identity, which would make them
identical to the ""what will happen"" labels (both 18-way softmaxes).

2. (presentation)
I think this distinction would usually be handled by the Reinforcement Learning
framework, but the proposed method is not presented in that framework or
related to an RL based approach. In RL ""what will happen"" is the reward an
agent will receive for making a particular action and ""what to do"" is the
action an agent should take. From this point of view, generalization from
""what will happen"" to ""what to do"" is not a novel thing to study.

Alternate models include:
    * A deep Q network (Mnih. et. al. 2015) could predict the value of
      every possible action where an action is a (player, board position) tuple.
    * The argmax of the current model's softmax could be used as an action
      prediction.
The deep Q network approach need not be implemented, but differences between
methods should be explained because of the uniqueness of the proposed approach.


* Comparison to work that uses visualization to investigate deep RL networks
is missing. In particular, other work in RL has used Simonyan et. al.
(arXiv 2013) style saliency maps to investigate network behavior. For example, 
""Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning"" by Wang et. al.
in (ICML 2016) uses saliency maps to identify differences between their
state-value and advantage networks. In ""Graying the black box:
Understanding DQNs"" by Zahavy et. al. (ICML 2016) these saliency maps are
also used to analyze network behavior.


* In section 2.3, saliency maps of Simonyan et. al. are said to not be able to
activate on grid squares because they have constant intensity, yet no empirical
or theoretical evidence is provided for this claim.

On a related note, what precisely is the notion of information referenced in
section 2.3 and why is it relevant? Is it entropy of the distribution of pixel
intensities in a patch? To me it seems that any measure which depends only
on one patch is irrelevant because the methods discussed (e.g., saliency maps)
depend on context as well as the intensities within a patch.


* The presentation in the paper would be improved if the results in section 7
were presented along with relevant discussion in preceding sections.


Overall Evaluation
===
The experiments presented here are novel, but I am not sure they are very
significant or offer clear conclusions. The methods and goals are not presented
clearly and lack the broader relevant context mentioned above. Furthermore, I
find the lines of thought mentioned in the Cons section possibly incorrect
or incomplete. As detailed with further clarifying questions, upon closer
inspection I do not see how some aspects of the proposed approach were
implemented, so my opinion may change with further details."
human,human,"This paper proposed a set of different things under the name of ""sampling generative models"", focusing on analyzing the learned latent space and synthesizing desirable output images with certain properties for GANs.  This paper does not have one single clear message or idea, but rather proposed a set of techniques that seem to produce visually good looking results.  While this paper has some interesting ideas, it also has a number of problems.

The spherical interpolation idea is interesting, but after a second thought this does not make much sense.  The proposed slerp interpolation equation (page 2) implicitly assumes that the two points q1 and q2 lie on the same sphere, in which case the parameter theta is the angle corresponding to the great arc connecting the two points on the sphere.  However, the latent space of a GAN, no matter trained with a uniform distribution or a Gaussian distribution, is not a distribution on a sphere, and many points have different distances to the origin.  The author's justification for this comes from the well known fact that in high dimensional space, even with a uniform distribution most points lie on a thin shell in the unit cube.  This is true because in high-dimensional space, the outer shell takes up most of the volume in space, and the inner part takes only a very small fraction of the space, in terms of volume.  This does not mean the density of data in the outer shell is greater than the inner part, though.  In a uniform distribution, the data density should be equal everywhere, a point on the outer shell is not more likely than a point in the inner part.  Under a Gaussian model, the data density is on the other hand higher in the center and much lower on the out side.  If we have a good model of data, then sampling the most likely points from the model should give us plausible looking samples.  In this sense, spherical interpolation should do no better than the normally used linear interpolation.  From the questions and answers it seems that the author does not recognize this distinction.  The results shown in this paper seem to indicate that spherical interpolation is better visually, but it is rather hard to make any concrete conclusions from three pairs of examples.  If this is really the case then there must be something else wrong about our understanding of the learned model.

Aside from these, the J-diagram and the nearest neighbor latent space traversal both seems to be good ways to explore the latent space of a learned model.  The attribute vector section on transforming images to new ones with desired attributes is also interesting, and it provides a few new ways to make the GAN latent space more interpretable.

Overall I feel most of the techniques proposed in this paper are nice visualization tools.  The contributions however, are mostly on the design of the visualizations, and not much on the technical and model side.  The spherical interpolation provides the only mathematical equation in the paper, yet the correctness of the technique is arguable.  For the visualization tools, there are also no quantitative evaluation, maybe these results are more art than science."

human,human,"The paper presents an application of a tensor factorization to linear models, which allows to consider higher-order interactions between variables in classification (and regression) problems, and that maintains computational feasibility, being linear in the dimension. The factorization employed is based on the TT format, first proposed by Oseledests (2011). The authors also propose the adoption of a Riemannian optimization scheme to explicit consider the geometry of the tensor manifold, and thus speed up convergence.

The paper in general is well written, it presents an interesting application of the TT tensor format for linear models (together with an application of Riemannian optimization), which in my opinion is quite interesting since it has a wide range of possible applications in different algorithms in machine learning.

On the other side, I have some concerns are about the experimental part, which I consider not at the level of the rest of the paper, for instance in terms of number of experiments on real datasets, role of dropout in real datasets, comparison with other algorithms on real datasets. Moreover the authors do not take into account explicitly the problem of the choice of the rank to be used in the experiments. In general the experimental section seems a collection of preliminary experiments where different aspects have been tested by not in a organic way.

I think the paper is close to a weak acceptance / weak rejection, I don't rate it as a full acceptance paper, mainly due to the non-satisfactory experiment setting. In case of extra experiments confirming the goodness of the approach, I believe the paper could have much better scores.

Some minor comments:
-formula 2: Obvious comment: learning the parameters of the model in (1) can be done as in (2), but also in other ways, depending on the approach you are using.

#### Title: Orthogonal Weight Regularization for Neural Networks

#### Summary:
The paper introduces a novel regularization technique called OrthoReg, which aims to improve the performance of neural networks by regularizing positively correlated feature weights. The authors hypothesize that negatively correlated features are not as detrimental to performance as positively correlated ones, and they propose a method to enforce local orthogonality between weight vectors. The technique is computationally efficient and is tested on datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN, showing promising results.

#### Strengths:

1. **Novelty**: The paper presents a new perspective on regularization by focusing on positively correlated weights, which is a fresh approach compared to traditional methods that do not differentiate between positive and negative correlations.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The use of cosine similarity to measure correlation between feature detectors is a well-founded choice, and the connection to the Frobenius norm of the cross-covariance matrix provides a solid mathematical basis for the proposed regularization technique.

3. **Computational Efficiency**: The authors emphasize the computational efficiency of OrthoReg, which is crucial for its applicability to large-scale models and datasets.

4. **Experimental Validation**: The paper includes experiments on multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of OrthoReg in reducing error rates, which supports the authors' claims.

5. **Complementary Nature**: The discussion on how OrthoReg can complement existing techniques like multi-bias neural networks is insightful and adds value to the proposed method.

#### Weaknesses:

1. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper could benefit from clearer organization and presentation. Some sections, particularly the mathematical derivations, are dense and may be difficult for readers to follow without additional explanation or simplification.

2. **Lack of Baseline Comparisons**: While the paper claims to achieve the lowest error rates on certain datasets, it lacks detailed comparisons with other state-of-the-art regularization techniques. Including such comparisons would strengthen the argument for OrthoReg's effectiveness.

3. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The paper does not sufficiently discuss the potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed method, such as scenarios where it might not perform well or any assumptions that may not hold in practice.

4. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The role of the hyperparameter γ, which weights the regularization term, is not thoroughly explored. Understanding its sensitivity and impact on performance would be valuable for practitioners.

5. **"
base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel framework termed ""nonparametric neural networks"" for dynamically selecting the size of a neural network during training. This approach aims to address the inefficiencies of traditional black-box model selection methods, which require multiple full training runs and do not adapt the model size during training. The paper introduces theoretical foundations, a new normalization layer (CapNorm), and a training algorithm (AdaRad) to support this framework.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The concept of nonparametric neural networks is innovative, offering a dynamic way to adjust network size during training. This could potentially lead to more efficient training processes and better-performing models.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper provides a theoretical justification for the proposed method, including a theorem that ensures the existence of a global training error minimum under certain conditions. This adds credibility to the approach.

3. **Practical Implications**: By potentially reducing the need for multiple full training runs, the proposed method could save significant computational resources, which is a major advantage in large-scale machine learning applications.

4. **Integration with Existing Techniques**: The use of fan-in and fan-out regularizers to induce sparsity and manage network size is a clever integration of existing techniques in a novel context.

### Weaknesses

1. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper could benefit from clearer organization and explanation, particularly in the introduction and theoretical sections. Some concepts are introduced without sufficient context or explanation, which may confuse readers unfamiliar with the topic.

2. **Experimental Validation**: The paper lacks detailed experimental results to validate the proposed method. While the theoretical foundation is strong, empirical evidence is crucial to demonstrate the practical effectiveness and efficiency of the approach.

3. **Comparison with Existing Methods**: There is limited discussion on how the proposed method compares with existing model selection and pruning techniques in terms of performance, computational efficiency, and ease of implementation.

4. **Complexity of Implementation**: The paper does not address the potential complexity of implementing the proposed framework in practice. Details on how to integrate the new normalization layer and training algorithm into existing neural network architectures would be helpful.

5. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The paper does not thoroughly discuss the assumptions and potential limitations of the proposed method. For instance, the reliance on specific types of regularizers and nonlinearities may limit the generalizability of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Enhance Clarity**: Improve the clarity and flow of the paper by providing more background information and"
human,human,"This paper presents an information theoretic framework for unsupervised learning. The framework relies on infomax principle, whose goal is to maximize the mutual information between input and output. The authors propose a two-step algorithm for learning in this setting. First, by leveraging an asymptotic approximation to the mutual information, the global objective is decoupled into two subgoals whose solutions can be expressed in closed form. Next, these serve as the initial guess for the global solution, and are refined by the gradient descent algorithm.

While the story of the paper and the derivations seem sound, the clarity and presentation of the material could improve. For example, instead of listing step by step derivation of each equation, it would be nice to first give a high-level presentation of the result and maybe explain briefly the derivation strategy. The very detailed aspects of derivations, which could obscure the underlying message of the result could perhaps be postponed to later sections or even moved to an appendix.

A few questions that the authors may want to clarify:
1. Page 4, last paragraph: ""from above we know that maximizing I(X;R) will result in maximizing I(Y;R) and I(X,Y^U)"". While I see the former holds due to equality in 2.20, the latter is related via a bound in 2.21. Due to the possible gap between I(X;R) and I(X,Y^U), can your claim that maximizing of the former indeed maximizes the latter be true?
2. Paragraph above section 2.2.2: it is stated that, dropout used to prevent overfitting may in fact be regarded as an attempt to reduce the rank of the weight matrix. No further tip is provided why this should be the case. Could you elaborate on that?
3. At the end of page 9: ""we will discuss how to get optimal solution of C for two specific cases"". If I understand correctly, you actually are not guaranteed to get the optimal solution of C in either case, and the best you can guarantee is reaching a local optimum. This is due to the nonconvexity of the constraint 2.80 (quadratic equality). If optimality cannot be guaranteed, please correct the wording accordingly.

human,human,"This paper presents a succinct argument that the principle of optimizing receptive field location and size in a simulated eye that can make saccades with respect to a classification error of images of data whose labels depend on variable-size and variable-location subimages, explains the existence of a foveal area in e.g. the primate retina.

The argument could be improved by using more-realistic image data and drawing more direct correspondence with the number, receptive field sizes and eccentricities of retinal cells in e.g. the macaque, but the authors would then face the challenge of identifying a loss function that is both biologically plausible and supportive of their claim.

The argument could also be improved by commenting on the timescales involved. Presumably the density of the foveal center depends on the number of of saccades allowed by the inference process, as well as the size of the target sub-images, and also has an impact on the overall classification accuracy.

Why does the classification error rate of dataset 2 remain stubbornly at 24%? This seems so high that the model may not be working the way we’d like it to. It seems that the overall argument of the paper pre-supposes that the model can be trained to be a good classifier. If there are other training strategies or other models that work better and differently, then it raises the question of why do our eyes and visual cortex not work more like *those ones* if evolutionary pressures are applying the same pressure as our training objective.

Why does the model with zooming powers out-do the translation-only model on dataset 1 (where all target images are the same size) and tie the translation-only model dataset 2 (where the target images have different sizes, for which the zooming model should be tailor-made?). Between this strange tie and the high classification rate on Dataset 2, I wonder if maybe one or both models isn’t being trained to its potential, which would undermine the overall claim.

Comparing this model to other attention models (e.g. spatial transformer networks, DRAW) would be irrelevant to what I take to be the main point of the paper, but it would address the potential concerns above that training just didn’t go very well, or there was some problem with the model parameterization that could be easily fixed."

#### Strengths

1. **Biological Inspiration**: The paper draws an interesting parallel between biological processes and computational models, specifically the use of open-bigrams in word recognition. This biological inspiration provides a novel perspective and could potentially lead to more efficient recognition systems.

2. **Comprehensive Literature Review**: The related work section provides a thorough overview of existing techniques in handwritten word recognition, categorizing them into three broad approaches. This helps in situating the proposed method within the current research landscape.

3. **Novel Representation**: The introduction of an open-bigram representation for words is a novel approach. By considering bigrams of varying orders, the method captures more contextual information than traditional bigram models.

4. **Mathematical Formulation**: The paper provides a clear mathematical formulation of the open-bigram representation and the decoding process. This clarity is crucial for understanding the proposed method and for potential replication by other researchers.

5. **Potential for Robustness**: The paper suggests that the open-bigram representation could be more robust to mispredictions due to its redundant nature. This is a promising aspect that could improve the accuracy of word recognition systems.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Results**: The paper mentions preliminary experiments but does not provide detailed results or analysis. This makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing techniques.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: There is little discussion on the potential limitations or challenges of the open-bigram approach. For instance, the computational complexity of handling a large set of bigrams or the impact of noise in the input data is not addressed.

3. **Insufficient Comparison with Baselines**: While the paper mentions related work, it does not provide a direct comparison of the proposed method with state-of-the-art techniques in terms of performance metrics such as accuracy, speed, or computational efficiency.

4. **Clarity and Structure**: Some sections of the paper, particularly the proposed method, could benefit from clearer explanations and more structured presentation. For example, the transition from the open-bigram representation to the decoder could be more explicitly outlined.

5. **Lack of Visual Aids**: The paper could benefit from more visual aids, such as diagrams or flowcharts, to illustrate the open-bigram representation and the decoding process. This would enhance understanding, especially for readers less familiar with the concepts.

----------

This paper addresses the problem of training stochastic feedforward neural networks.  It proposes to transfer weights from a deterministic deep neural network trained using standard procedures (including techniques such as dropout and batch normalization) to a stochastic network having the same topology.  The initial mechanism described for performing the transfer involves a rescaling of unit inputs and layer weights, and appropriate specification of the stochastic latent units if the DNN used for pretraining employs ReLU nonlinearities.  Initial experiments on MNIST classification and a toy generative task with a multimodal target distribution show that the simple transfer process works well if the DNN used for pretraining uses sigmoid nonlinearities, but not if the pretraining DNN uses ReLUs.  To tackle this problem, the paper introduces the ""simplified stochastic feedforward neural network,"" in which every stochastic layer is followed by a layer that takes an expectation over samples from its input, thus limiting the propagation of stochasticity in the network.  A modified process for transferring weights from a pretraining DNN to the simplified SFNN is described and justified.  The training process then occurs in three steps:  (1) pretrain a DNN, (2) transfer weights from the DNN to a simplified SFNN and continue training, and (3) optionally transfer the weights to a full SFNN and continue training or transfer them to a deterministic model (called DNN*) and continue training.  The third step can be skipped and the simplified SFNN may also be used directly as an inference model.  Experimental results on MNIST classification show that the use of simplified SFNN training can improve a deterministic DNN* model over a DNN baseline trained with batch normalization and dropout.  Experiments on two generative tasks (MNIST-half and the Toronto Faces Database) show that the proposed pretraining process improves test set negative log-likelihoods.  Finally, experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN with the LeNet-5, network-in-network, and wide residual network architectures show that use of a stochastic training step can improve performance of a deterministic (DNN*) model.

It is a bit confusing to refer to ""multi-modal"" tasks, when what is meant is ""generative tasks with a multimodal target distribution"" because ""multi-modal"" task can also refer to a learning task that crosses sensory modalities such as audio-visual speech recognition, text-based image retrieval, or image captioning.  I recommend that you use the more precise term (""generative tasks with a multimodal target distribution"") early in the introduction and then say that you will refer to such tasks as ""multi-modal tasks"" in the rest of the paper for the sake of brevity.

The paper would be easier to read if ""SFNN"" were not used to refer to both the singular (""stochastic feedforward neural network"") and plural (""stochastic feedforward neural networks"") cases.  When the plural is meant, write ""SFNNs"".

In Table 1, why does the 3 hidden layer SFNN initialized from a ReLU DNN have so much worse of a test NLL than the 2 hidden layer SFNN initialized from a ReLU DNN?

The notation that uses superscripts to indicate layer indexes is confusing.  The reader naturally parses N² as ""N squared"" and not as ""the number of units in the second layer.""

When you transfer weights back from the simplified SFNN to the DNN* model, do you need to perform some sort of rescaling that undoes the operations in Equation (8) in the paper?

What does NCSFNN stand for in the supplementary material?

Pros
+ The proposed model is easy to implement and apply to other tasks.
+ The MNIST results showing that the stochastic model training can produce a deterministic model (called DNN* in the paper) that generalizes better than a DNN trained with batch normalization and dropout is quite exciting.

Cons
- For the reasons outlined above, the paper is at times a bit hard to follow.
- The results CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN would be more convincing if the baselines used dropout and batch normalization.  While this is shown on MINST, demonstration of a similar result on a more challenging task would strengthen the paper.

Paper summary: this work presents ENet, a new convnet architecture for semantic labeling which obtains comparable performance to the previously existing SegNet while being ~10x faster and using ~10x less memory. 


Review summary: Albeit the results seem interesting, the paper lacks detailed experimental results, and is of limited interest for the ICLR audience.


Pros:
* 10x faster
* 10x smaller
* Design rationale described in detail


Cons:
* The quality of the reference baseline is low. For instance, cityscapes results are 58.3 IoU while state of the art is ~80 IoU. Thus the results are of limited interest.
* The results that support the design rationale are not provided. It is important to provide the experimental evidence to support each claim.


Quality: the work is interesting but feels incomplete. If your model is 10x faster and smaller, why not try build a model 10x longer to obtain improved results ? The paper focuses only on  nimbleness at the cost of quality (using a weak baseline). This limits the interest for the ICLR audience.


Clarity: the overall text is somewhat clear, but the model description (section 3) could be more clear. 


Originality: the work is a compendium of “practitioners wisdom” applied to a specific task. It has thus limited originality.


Significance: I find the work that establishes a new “best practices all in one” quite interesting, but however these must shine in all aspects. Being fast at the cost of quality, will limit the impact of this work.


Minor comments:
* Overall the text is proper english but the sentences constructions is often unsound, specific examples below. 
* To improve the chances of acceptance, I invite the authors to also explore bigger models and show that the same “collected wisdom” can be used both to reach high speed and high quality (with the proper trade-off curve being shown). Aiming for only one end of the quality versus speed curve limits too much the paper.
* Section 1: “mobile or battery powered … require rates > 10 fps“. 10 fps with which energy budget ? Should not this be  > 10 fps && < X Watt.
* “Rules and ideas” -> rules seem too strong of a word, “guidelines” ?
* “Is of utmost importance” -> “is of importance” (important is already important)
* “Presents a trainable network … therefore we compare to … the large majority of inference the same way”; the sentence makes no sense to me, I do not see the logical link between before and after “therefore”
* Scen-parsing -> scene-parsing
* It is arguable if encoder and decoder can be called “separate”
* “Unlike in Noh” why is that relevant ? Make explicit or remove
* “Real-time” is vague, you mean X fps @ Y W ?
* Other existing architectures -> Other architectures
* Section 3, does not the BN layer include a bias term ? Can you get good results without any bias term ?
* Table 1: why is the initial layer a downsampling one, since the results has half the size of the input ?
* Section 4, non linear operations. What do you mean by “settle to recurring pattern” ?
* Section 4, dimensionality changes. “Computationally expensive”, relative to what ?
* Section 4, dimensionality changes. “This technique ... speeds-up ten times”, but does not provide the same results. Without an experimental validation changing an apple for an orange does not make the orange better than the apple.
* Section 4, dimensionality changes. “Found one problem”, problem would imply something conceptually wrong. This is more an “issue” or an “miss-match” when using ResNet for semantic labelling.
* Section 4, factorizing filters. I am unsure of why you call nx1 filter asymmetric. A filter could be 1xn yet be symmetric (e.g. -2 -1 0 1 2). Why not simply call them rectangular filters ?
* Section 4, factorizing filters. Why would this change increase the variety ? I would have expected the opposite.
* Section 4, regularization. Define “much better”.
* Section 5.1; “640x360 is adequate for practical applications”; for _some_ applications.
* Section 5.2, “very quickly” is vague and depends on the reader expectations, please be quantitative.
* Section 5.2, Haver -> have
* Section 5.2, in this work -> In this work
* Section 5.2, unclear what you use the class weighting for. Is this for class balancing ?
* Section 5.2, Cityscapes was -> Cityscapes is
* Section 5.2, weighted by the average -> is each instance weighted relative the average object size.
* Section 5.2, fastest model in the Cityscapes -> fastest model in the public Cityscapes"
base,gpt-4o,"**Review of the Paper on Zero-Shot Task Generalization in Reinforcement Learning**

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Relevance:** The paper addresses a significant challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) - zero-shot task generalization. This is a crucial capability for artificial agents, as it mirrors human-like adaptability to new tasks without additional learning. The focus on instruction execution and the ability to generalize to unseen and longer sequences of instructions is both novel and relevant to advancing RL.

2. **Hierarchical Architecture:** The proposed hierarchical deep RL architecture, which includes a meta controller and a subtask controller, is well-conceived. This structure allows for the decomposition of tasks into subtasks, facilitating the generalization to new tasks. The use of parameterized options and analogy-making regularization are innovative approaches to enhance generalization.

3. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides empirical results from a 2D grid world environment and a 3D visual environment, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture. The results indicate that the architecture can generalize in a zero-shot fashion to unseen tasks, which is a significant achievement.

4. **Comprehensive Related Work:** The paper includes a thorough review of related work, situating the research within the broader context of hierarchical RL, zero-shot learning, and instruction execution. This helps to clarify the contributions of the paper and how it advances the state of the art.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Clarity and Organization:** The paper could benefit from improved clarity and organization. Some sections, particularly the introduction and related work, are dense and could be better structured to enhance readability. Breaking down complex ideas into simpler components and using more subheadings could help.

2. **Lack of Detailed Explanation:** While the paper introduces several novel concepts, such as analogy-making regularization and the differentiable neural architecture for the meta controller, these are not explained in sufficient detail. More in-depth explanations and possibly illustrative examples would help readers understand these contributions better.

3. **Limited Scope of Experiments:** The experiments are primarily conducted in a 2D grid world and a 3D visual environment. While these are useful for initial validation, the paper would be strengthened by testing the architecture in more diverse and complex environments to demonstrate its robustness and scalability.

4. **Assumptions and Limitations:** The paper does not sufficiently discuss the assumptions underlying the proposed approach or its limitations. For instance, the assumption that the agent does not receive intermediate feedback could be a significant constraint in real-world applications."

**Strengths:**

1. **Novelty and Contribution:**
   - The paper introduces a novel state space model specifically designed for relational time series, which is a relatively underexplored area in representation learning. The model's ability to handle both intra-series and inter-series dependencies is a significant contribution.
   - The use of Gaussian distributions in the latent space to model uncertainties at both the observation and dynamic levels is innovative and aligns with recent trends in representation learning.

2. **Comprehensive Literature Review:**
   - The paper provides a thorough review of related work, covering both classical statistical approaches and modern machine learning techniques. This contextualizes the proposed model within the broader landscape of time series forecasting and representation learning.

3. **Clear Problem Definition:**
   - The paper clearly defines the problem of forecasting relational time series and distinguishes it from traditional time series forecasting by emphasizing the relational dependencies.

4. **Potential for Real-World Applications:**
   - The model's applicability to various domains such as ecology, medicine, and social data analysis is well-articulated, suggesting a wide range of potential real-world applications.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Detailed Methodology:**
   - The paper provides an informal description of the model but lacks a detailed mathematical formulation. Key components such as the dynamics in the latent space and the decoder function are not explicitly defined, which makes it difficult to fully understand the model's workings.

2. **Experimental Validation:**
   - While the paper mentions experimental results on four datasets, it does not provide details on the datasets, experimental setup, or evaluation metrics. This lack of information makes it challenging to assess the model's performance and generalizability.

3. **Comparison with Baselines:**
   - There is no mention of how the proposed model compares with existing state-of-the-art models for relational time series forecasting. A comparative analysis with baselines would strengthen the paper's claims about the model's effectiveness.

4. **Assumptions and Limitations:**
   - The paper assumes a static graph structure for modeling dependencies, which may not be realistic in dynamic environments. Discussing the limitations of this assumption and potential extensions to dynamic graphs would be beneficial.

5. **Clarity and Organization:**
   - The paper could benefit from improved organization and clarity. For instance, the transition from the introduction to the related work section is abrupt, and the informal description of the model lacks coherence.

human,human,"Dear ACs,

We are concerned about the quality of review provided by Reviewer #4. The only point of criticism offered by the reviewer is that ""the proposed solution depends on a reasonably good dialogue model to begin with, which is not guaranteed, rendering the new metric possibly meaningless."" We believe the review indicates that the reviewer did not thoroughly read or understand our paper, for several reasons:

1) As stated in the rebuttal, the claim that our model 'depends on a good dialogue model to begin with' is false. This can be seen by simply looking at our main results table, where we have additional results using publicly available sentence embedding methods (i.e. tweet2vec). What our method does require is a sentence embedding method, but we believe this is hardly a limitation of the work. 

2) Several details in the reviewer's summary of our paper are incorrect (it is not simply an LSTM used to encode the context, but a hierarchical model; our evaluation method is not in itself a dialogue model, as explained to Reviewer #1), although we do not mention this in our rebuttal. 

3) As stated in the rebuttal, we show that our evaluation procedure works (is correlated with human judgements) on a dataset (Twitter) that has seen the significant use in the recent literature. It is obvious that our method works on this popular dataset (since we demonstrate it in our experiments); thus, the claim that our method is 'meaningless' is not accurate (it would be very useful even if it only worked for Twitter).

4) Finally, the domain in which the reviewer implies our method would be 'meaningless' (when there exists no sentence embedding method for that domain) is very small: it encompasses only domains that (a) have too little data to train an embedding method (and if this is the case, it likely has too little data to train a dialogue model anyway), and (b) are different enough from all existing domains such that transfer learning can't be used (i.e. one can't use a generic embedding method such as skip-thought). The majority of domains studied in the literature (Twitter, Ubuntu, Reddit, movies, etc.) do not satisfy these criteria.

This is not to say there are no valid criticisms of our work -- indeed, the review provided by Reviewer #1 (although we believe they are mistaken) at least indicates that the reviewer read the paper. 

We would appreciate if this could be taken into consideration when deciding whether to accept or reject this paper.


Thanks,

-The Authors"
human,human,"(paper summary) The authors introduce the notion of “sample importance”, meant to measure the influence of a particular training example on the training of a deep neural network. This quantity is closely related to the squared L2 norm of the gradient, where the summation is performed over (i) parameters of a given layer or (ii) across all parameters. Summing this quantity across time gives the “overall importance”, used to tease apart easy from hard examples. From this quantity, the authors illustrate the impact of [easy,hard] example during training, and their impact on layer depth.

(detailed review)
I have several objections to this paper. First and foremost, I am not convinced of the “sample importance” as a meaningful metric. As previously mentioned, the magnitude of gradients will change significantly during learning, and I am not sure what conclusions one can draw from \sum_t g_i^t vs \sum_t g_j^t. For example, gradients tend to have higher norms early in training than at convergence, in which case weighting each gradient equally seems problematic. I tried illustrating the above with a small thought experiment during the question period: “if” the learning rate were too high, training may not even converge in which case sample importance would be ill-defined.  Having a measure which depends on the learning rate seems problematic to me, as does the use of the L2 norm. The “input Fisher” norm, \mathbb{E} \frac{\partial \log p} {\partial x} (for a given time-step) may be better suited, as it speaks directly to the sensitivity of the classifier to the input x (and is insensitive to changes in the mean gradient norm). But again summing Fisher norms across time may not be meaningful.

The experimental analysis also seems problematic. The authors claim from Fig. 2 that output layers are primarily learnt in the early stage of training. However, this is definitely not the case for CIFAR-10 and is debatable for MNIST: sample importance remains high for all layers during training, despite a small spike early on the output layer. Fig 2. (lower, middle) and Fig. 6 also seems to highlight an issue with the SI measure: the SI is dominated by the input layer which has the most parameters, and can thus more readily impact the gradient norm. Different model architectures may have yielded different conclusions. Had the authors managed to use the SI to craft a better curriculum, this would have given significant weight to the measure. Unfortunately, these results are negative.

PROS:
+ extensive experiments

CONS:
- sample importance is a heuristic, not entirely well justified
- SI yields limited insight into training of neural nets
- SI does not inform curriculum learning"
base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a comprehensive exploration of implicit generative models, focusing on their distinction from prescribed models and the challenges associated with their likelihood-free nature. It delves into the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a solution for learning in these models and discusses various approaches for likelihood-free inference, particularly emphasizing density ratio estimation through class probability estimation.

### Strengths:

1. **Clear Distinction and Motivation**: The paper effectively distinguishes between prescribed and implicit probabilistic models, providing a clear motivation for the use of implicit models in various scientific domains such as climate modeling and ecology. This sets a strong foundation for understanding the relevance and importance of implicit generative models.

2. **Comprehensive Overview**: The paper provides a thorough overview of the challenges associated with implicit generative models, particularly the intractability of the likelihood function. It also covers various methods for likelihood-free inference, offering a broad perspective on the current state of research in this area.

3. **Connection to GANs**: By linking implicit generative models to GANs, the paper situates its discussion within a well-known and active area of research. This connection is valuable for readers familiar with GANs and provides a practical framework for implementing implicit models.

4. **Detailed Explanation of Density Ratio Estimation**: The paper provides a detailed explanation of how density ratio estimation can be used for learning in implicit models, particularly through class probability estimation. This section is well-articulated and provides a clear pathway for implementing these concepts.

### Weaknesses:

1. **Lack of Empirical Results**: The paper is primarily theoretical and lacks empirical results or experiments to validate the discussed methods. Including experimental results would strengthen the paper by demonstrating the practical applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

2. **Complexity and Accessibility**: The paper is dense with technical details and mathematical formulations, which might be challenging for readers who are not well-versed in probabilistic modeling or machine learning. Simplifying some of the explanations or providing more intuitive insights could make the paper more accessible.

3. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: While the paper discusses the challenges of implicit models, it does not thoroughly address the limitations or potential drawbacks of the proposed methods, such as computational complexity or scalability issues.

4. **Missing References to Recent Work**: The paper references foundational works and some recent studies, but it could benefit from a more comprehensive review of the latest advancements in implicit generative models and GANs, especially given the rapid development in these fields.

base,gpt-4o,"The paper introduces a novel approach to sparse coding, termed Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding (EB-SSC), which aims to address the computational inefficiencies of traditional sparse coding methods by using unit length codes and a reconstruction loss based on cosine similarity. The paper proposes a bi-directional coding method that incorporates both top-down and bottom-up information, inspired by the ""Biased Competition Theory"" from cognitive neuroscience.

### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Innovation**: The paper presents a novel approach to sparse coding by introducing unit length codes and leveraging cosine similarity for reconstruction loss. This is an interesting departure from traditional least-squares minimization, potentially offering computational benefits.

2. **Bi-Directional Coding**: The integration of both top-down and bottom-up information is a compelling idea, aligning with cognitive theories and potentially offering more robust feature representations for classification tasks.

3. **Theoretical Insights**: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for the proposed method, including a relaxation of the convolutional sparse coding problem and a discussion on the efficiency of the proposed approach.

4. **Potential Computational Efficiency**: By avoiding iterative optimization, the proposed method could offer significant computational savings, making it more suitable for large-scale applications compared to traditional sparse coding methods.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Validation**: The paper does not provide empirical results or experiments to validate the proposed method. Without experimental evidence, it is difficult to assess the practical effectiveness and efficiency of EB-SSC compared to existing methods.

2. **Complexity and Clarity**: The paper is dense with theoretical concepts and mathematical formulations, which may be challenging for readers to follow. The explanation of the proposed method could be clearer, with more intuitive descriptions and examples.

3. **Comparison with Existing Methods**: While the paper discusses the limitations of traditional sparse coding, it lacks a detailed comparison with other modern approaches, such as deep learning models, which have largely replaced sparse coding in many applications.

4. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The paper does not thoroughly discuss the assumptions and potential limitations of the proposed method. For instance, the relaxation of the convolutional sparse coding problem might lead to suboptimal solutions in certain cases.

5. **Incomplete Sections**: The paper seems to be incomplete, as the section on ""Top-Down Classification"" is cut off. This leaves a gap in understanding how the top-down component is integrated and evaluated.

human,human,"The authors propose and evaluate using SPN's to generate embeddings of input and output variables, and using MPN to decode output embeddings to output variables. The advantage of predicting label embeddings is to decouple dependencies in the predicted space. The authors show experimentally that using SPN based embeddings is better than those produced by RBM's.

This paper is fairly dense and a bit hard to read. After the discussion, the main contributions of the authors are:

1. They propose the scheme of learning SPN's over Y and then using MPN's to decode the output, or just SPNs to embed X.
2. They propose how to decode MPN's with partial data.
3. They perform some analysis of when their scheme will lead to perfect encoding/decodings.
4. They run many, many experiments comparing various ways of using their proposed method to make predictions on multi-label classification datasets.

My main concerns with this paper are as follows:

- The point of this paper is about using generative models for representation learning. In their experiments, the main task is discriminative; e.g. predict multiple Y from X. The only discriminative baseline is a L2 regularized logistic regression, which does not have any structure on the output; it'd be nice to see how a discriminative structured prediction method would do, such as CRF or belief propagation. 

- The many experiments suggest that their encoder/decoder scheme is working better than the alternatives; can you please give more details on the relative computation complexity of each method?

- One thing I'm still having trouble understanding is *why* this method works better than MADE and the other alternatives. Is it learning a better model of the distribution of Y? Is it better at separating out correlations in the output into individual nodes?  Does it have larger representations? 

- I think the experiments are overkill and if anything, they way they are presented detract from the paper. There's already far too many numbers and graphs presented to be easy to understand.  If I have to dig through hundreds of numbers to figure out if your claim is correct, the paper is not clear enough. And, I said this before in my comments, please do not refer to Q1, Q2, etc. -- these shortcuts let you make the paper more dense with fewer words but at the cost of readability.

I *think* I convinced myself that your method works...I would love to see a table that shows, for each condition: (A) a baseline X->Y, (B) one *average* result across datasets for your method, and (C) one *average* result from a reasonable best competitor method. Please show for both the exact match and hamming losses, as that will demonstrate the gap between independent linear prediction and structured prediction. That would still be plenty of numbers but would make it much easier for the reader to verify your claims and you can put everything else in the Appendix.  E.g. something like:

Input | Predicted Output | Decoder | Hamming | Exact Match
----
X | P(Y) | CRF | xx.xx | xx.xx   (this is your baseline)
SPN E_X | P(Y) | n/a | xx.xx | xx.xx 
X | SPN E_Y | MPN | xx.xx | xx.xx  (given X, predict E_Y, then decode it with an MPN)

Does a presentation like that make sense? It's just really hard and time-consuming for me as a reviewer to verify your results, the way you've laid them out currently.

base,gpt-4o,"**Title: Unspecified**

**Review:**

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Importance:** The paper addresses a significant problem in natural language processing (NLP) related to paraphrase acquisition and lexical substitution. The ability to automatically replace words with their meaning-equivalent paraphrases in context is crucial for various NLP applications, such as machine translation and semantic representation.

2. **Novel Approach:** The authors propose a novel method for clustering paraphrases in the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) using a multi-view clustering algorithm. This approach is innovative as it incorporates different views of paraphrase similarity, such as lexical substitution rankings, overlap in foreign translations, and similarity to WordNet synsets.

3. **Generalizability:** The proposed method is generalizable to all parts of speech and languages, which enhances its applicability across different linguistic contexts.

4. **Evaluation Metric:** The use of the B-Cubed F-Score as a cluster quality metric to evaluate the substitutability of sense inventories is a well-thought-out choice. It provides a quantitative measure of how well the sense clusters align with human judgments.

5. **Empirical Validation:** The paper provides empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving lexical substitution performance, as evidenced by the agreement with human-generated lexsub annotations.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Clarity in Presentation:** The paper could benefit from clearer explanations in some sections. For instance, the transition from the introduction to the methodology is abrupt, and the details of the multi-view clustering algorithm are not sufficiently elaborated.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations:** The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the proposed approach. For example, potential challenges in scaling the method to larger datasets or its dependency on the quality of the initial paraphrase database are not addressed.

3. **Comparative Analysis:** While the paper mentions existing sense inventories like WordNet+ and TWSI, it lacks a detailed comparative analysis of how the proposed method performs relative to these baselines in various contexts.

4. **Supplemental Material:** The paper references supplemental material for the implementation details of the B-Cubed F-Score, which is not ideal for a standalone paper. Key aspects of the methodology should be included in the main text to ensure the paper is self-contained.

5. **Insufficient Examples:** The paper provides limited examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. More examples, especially those highlighting edge cases or failures, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method"
human,human,"The paper contributes to recent work investigating how neural networks can be used on graph-structured data. As far as I can tell, the proposed approach is the following:

  1. Construct a hierarchical set of ""objects"" within the graph. Each object consists of multiple ""parts"" from the set of objects in the level below. There are potentially different ways a part can be part of an object (the different \pi labels), which I would maybe call ""membership types"". In the experiments, the objects at the bottom level are vertices. At the next level they are radius 0 (just a vertex?) and radius 1 neighborhoods around each vertex, and the membership types here are either ""root"", or ""element"" (depending on whether a vertex is the center of the neighborhood or a neighbor). At the top level there is one object consisting of all of these neighborhoods, with membership types of ""radius 0 neighborhood"" (isn't this still just a vertex?) or ""radius 1 neighborhood"".

  2. Every object has a representation. Each vertex's representation is a one-hot encoding of its degree. To construct an object's representation at the next level, the following scheme is employed:

    a. For each object, sum the representation of all of its parts having the same membership type.
    b. Concatenate the sums obtained from different membership types.
    c. Pass this vector through a multi-layer neural net.

I've provided this summary mainly because the description in the paper itself is somewhat hard to follow, and relevant details are scattered throughout the text, so I'd like to verify that my understanding is correct.

Some additional questions I have that weren't clear from the text: how many layers and hidden units were used? What are the dimensionalities of the representations used at each layer? How is final classification performed? What is the motivation for the chosen ""ego-graph"" representation? 

The proposed approach is interesting and novel, the compression technique appears effective, and the results seem compelling. However, the clarity and structure of the writing is quite poor. It took me a while to figure out what was going on---the initial description is provided without any illustrative examples, and it required jumping around the paper to figure for example how the \pi labels are actually used. Important details around network architecture aren't provided, and very little in the way of motivation is given for many of the choices made. Were other choices of decomposition/object-part structures investigated, given the generality of the shift-aggregate-extract formulation? What motivated the choice of ""ego-graphs""? Why one-hot degrees for the initial attributes?

Overall, I think the paper contains a useful contribution on a technical level, but the presentation needs to be significantly cleaned up before I can recommend acceptance."

**Title:** The paper does not provide a title, but it appears to focus on constructing semantic hierarchies using word embeddings and a fusion learning architecture.

**Strengths:**

1. **Novel Approach:** The paper proposes a novel fusion architecture that combines discriminative and generative models for learning semantic hierarchies. This approach is innovative and attempts to address the limitations of previous methods that rely solely on linear transformations of word embeddings.

2. **Performance Improvement:** The proposed method achieves an F1-score of 74.20% and a precision of 91.60%, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods. This indicates that the approach is effective in improving the accuracy of hypernym-hyponym relation discovery.

3. **Language Independence:** The method is described as language-independent, which is a significant advantage as it can be applied to multiple languages without requiring language-specific modifications.

4. **Integration of Lexical Structures:** The paper integrates a simple lexical structure rule into the fusion architecture, which is a thoughtful addition to enhance the semantic information captured by word embeddings.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Incomplete Content:** The paper appears to be incomplete, with missing sections and abrupt transitions. This makes it difficult to fully understand the methodology and the experiments conducted.

2. **Lack of Detailed Explanation:** The paper lacks detailed explanations of the proposed fusion architecture, the specific models used, and how they are integrated. More information is needed on the architecture's design and implementation.

3. **Missing Figures and Tables:** References to figures (e.g., Figure 1) and possibly tables are made, but they are not included in the text provided. These visual aids are crucial for understanding the structure of semantic hierarchies and the results of experiments.

4. **Literature Review:** While the paper provides a brief overview of related work, it could benefit from a more comprehensive literature review that situates the proposed method within the broader context of semantic hierarchy construction.

5. **Evaluation Details:** The evaluation section lacks details on the dataset used, the experimental setup, and the metrics for comparison. This information is essential for assessing the validity and reproducibility of the results.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Complete the Paper:** Ensure that the paper is complete with all sections, figures, and tables included. This will provide a clearer understanding of the research conducted.

human,human,"Variational auto-encoders, adversarial networks, and kernel scoring rules like MMD have recently gained popularity as methods for learning directed generative models and for other applications like domain adaptation. This paper gives an additional method along the scoring rules direction that uses the matching of central moments to match two probability distributions. The technique is simple, and in the case of domain adaptation, highly effective.

CMD seems like a very nice and straightforward solution to the domain adaptation problem. The method is computationally straightforward to implement, and seems quite stable with respect to the tuning parameters when compared to MMD. I was skeptical reading through this, especially given the fact that you only use K=5 in your experiments, but the results seem quite good. The natural question that I have now is: how will this method do in training generative models? This is beyond the scope of this paper, but it’s the lowest hanging fruit.

Below I give more detailed feedback.

One way to speed up MMD is to use a random Fourier basis as was done in “Fastmmd: Ensemble of circular discrepancy for efficient two-sample test” by Zhao and Meng, 2015. There are also linear time estimators, e.g., in “A Kernel Two-Sample Test“ by Gretton et al., 2012. I don’t think you need to compare against these approaches since you compare to the full MMD, but they should be cited.

The paper “Generative Models and Model Criticism via Optimized Maximum Mean Discrepancy” by Sutherland et al. submitted to ICLR 2017 as well, discusses techniques for optimizing the kernel used in MMD and is worth citing in section 3.

How limiting is the assumption that the distribution has independent marginals?

The sample complexity of MMD depends heavily on the dimensionality of the input space - do you have any intuitions about the sample complexity of CMD? It seems like it's relatively insensitive based on the results in Figure 4, but I would be surprised if this were the case with 10,000 hidden units. I mainly ask this because with generative models, the output space can be quite high-dimensional.

I’m concerned that the central moments won’t be numerically stable at higher orders when backpropagating. This doesn’t seem to be a problem in the experimental results, but perhaps the authors could comment a bit on this? I’m referring to the fact that ck(X) can be very large for k >= 3. Proposition 1 alleviates my concerns that the overall objective is unstable, I’m referring specifically to the individual terms within.

Figure 3 is rather cluttered, and aside from the mouse class it’s not clear to me from the visualization that the CMD regularizer is actually helping. It would be useful to remove some of the classes for the purpose of visualization.

I would like some clarification about the natural geometric interpretations of K=5. Do you mean that the moments up to K=5 have been well-studied? Do you have any references for this? Why does K >= 6 not have a natural geometric interpretation?

human,human,"The primary point made by this paper is that given certain architectural characteristics of multi-GPU systems, namely the use of bi-directional PCI-E for communication and the integration of two independent DMA engines on recent GPU devices (providing support for simultaneous independent communications), and given the characteristics of the communications patterns required by synchronous SGD trainers for deep neural networks, namely that the messages are large, dense, and have a fixed length, it makes sense to design communication collectives such as broadcast, reduce, and allreduce specifically for the use case of synchronous SGD training on a multi-GPU system.  The paper describes the implementation of these three collectives (broadcast, reduce, and allreduce) using a linear pipelining (LP) scheme on a (logical) ring topology.  The paper compares the LP collectives to two alternatives:  collectives based on a minimal spanning tree (MST) topology and collectives based on bidirectional exchange (BE).  First, a theoretical comparison is made using a standard cost model used in the high performance computing community.  When assumptions based on multi-GPU system architecture (very low latency for messages) and on the communication characteristics of synchronous SGD training (very large messages) are integrated into the model, the paper finds that the LP collectives should be less costly than BE collectives by a factor of 2 and less costly than MST collectives by a factor of log(p), where p is the number of GPUs being used.  Second, an empirical comparison is performed in which (1) the time required to perform each of the different collectives on a 4-device (k40m) system is measured as a function of message size and (2) the time required to perform each of the different collectives with a 200 MB message length is measured as a function of the number of devices in the system.  These measurements show that the LP-based collectives are consistently the fastest.  Third, DNN training experiments with AlexNet and GoogLeNet are performed on a 4-device system using three different synchronous SGD algorithms with the different implementations of the collectives (a total of 6 different algorithms in all).  Measurements of the communication and computation costs show that the LP collectives reduce communication costs without affecting computation costs (as expected).  Measurements of the convergence of the training loss as a function of time for the two DNN architectures show that use of the LP collectives leads to faster training.

While the theory says that the costs of LP collectives should be invariant to the number of devices in a multi-GPU system, the empirical work shows that in practice this does not hold going from 4 to 5 devices (in the tested configuration) because in a 5-device system messages must traverse the QPI.  Are there other practical considerations that the authors are aware of that affect the scaling of the LP collectives?  If so, these should be mentioned in the paper.

In the sentence ""Worringen (2003) proposed a pipeline collective model in shared memory environment for CPU data, but communications of different MPI processes sharing the same CPU memory bus within the same CPU socket."" I really can't figure out what the words after ""but communications of different MPI processes"" are trying to convey.  This sentence is not comprehensible.

""Please note the latency term is log pα, which is the smallest among algorithms in Table.1. Therefore, MST only suits for high frequent short messages.""  The claim that MST collectives are only suitable for high-frequency, short messages does not follow from the statement that MST collectives have the smallest latency term.  You also need to consider the way the cost scales with message size (the bandwidth term).  If the MST collectives had a better bandwidth term than the other collectives, then they would also be superior for large messages.

""Let’s take an appropriate block size b to ensure n/b ≪ α.""  This looks wrong, since n > b.  Should it be b/n ≪ α?

""However, the parameters are not consistent after several iterations due to the precision issues of float multiplications in Gradient Update.""  Are you sure the inconsistency in weight estimates across devices is due to multiplication?  I would expect that it would be due to gradients being accumulated in different orders; that is, because floating point addition is not commutative.

I recommend replacing the term ""sub-gradients"" in this paper with ""partial gradients.""  In the optimization literature, the term ""sub-gradient"" has a very specific meaning that differs from this paper's use of the term (see"

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper introduces a novel method for relation extraction by framing it as a reading comprehension task. This is a creative approach that leverages the strengths of existing reading comprehension models to address the limitations of traditional relation extraction methods.

2. **Zero-Shot Learning Capability:** The proposed method allows for zero-shot learning, enabling the extraction of relations that were not predefined or observed during training. This is a significant advancement over traditional methods that require predefined schemas.

3. **Scalability:** By using schema querification, the approach efficiently generalizes across instances, reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. This scalability is a practical advantage for real-world applications.

4. **Comprehensive Dataset:** The authors have created a large dataset with over 30 million question-sentence-answer examples, which is a valuable resource for training and evaluating reading comprehension models in the context of relation extraction.

5. **Empirical Results:** The experiments demonstrate that the model can generalize to new paraphrases and unseen relations, achieving a reasonable F1 score. This provides evidence of the model's effectiveness and potential for practical use.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Dependence on Question Quality:** The success of the approach heavily relies on the quality and coverage of the natural-language questions generated for each relation. If the questions are not well-crafted or comprehensive, the model's performance may suffer.

2. **Handling of Unanswerable Questions:** While the paper mentions extending the model to handle unanswerable questions, it does not provide detailed insights into how effectively this is achieved or the specific challenges encountered.

3. **Limited Analysis of Failure Cases:** The paper acknowledges that there are many feasible cases the model does not master, but it lacks a thorough analysis of these failure cases. Understanding these limitations could provide valuable insights for future improvements.

4. **Generalization to Complex Relations:** The approach may struggle with more complex relations that require deeper semantic understanding or context beyond simple question-answer pairs. The paper does not address how these challenges might be overcome.

5. **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper primarily reports F1 scores, but additional metrics such as precision, recall, and qualitative analysis of extracted relations could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Enhance Question Generation:** Invest in improving the question generation process, possibly by incorporating more sophisticated natural language generation techniques or leveraging large language models to ensure high-quality and diverse questions.

human,human,"This paper explores the performance-area-energy-model accuracy tradeoff encountered in designing custom number representations for deep learning inference. Common image-based benchmarks: VGG, Googlenet etc are used to demonstrate that fewer than1 6 bits in a custom floating point representation can lead to improvement in runtime performance and energy efficiency with only a small loss in model accuracy.

Questions:

1. Does the custom floating point number representation take into account support for de-normal numbers? 
2. Is the custom floating point unit clocked at the same frequency as the baseline 32-bit floating point unit? If not, what are the different frequencies used and how would this impact the overall system design in terms of feeding the data to the floating point units from the memory

Comments:

1. I would recommend using the IEEE half-precision floating point (1bit sign, 5bit exponent, and 10bit mantissa) as a baseline for comparison. At this point, it is well known in both the ML and the HW communities that 32-bit floats are an overkill for DNN inference and major HW vendors already include support for IEEE half-precision floats. 
2. In my opinion, the claim that switching to custom floating point  lead to a YY.ZZ x savings in energy is misleading. It might be true that the floating-point unit itself might consume less energy due to smaller bit-width of the operands, however a large fraction of the total energy is spent in data movement to/from the memories. As a result, reducing the floating point unit’s energy consumption by a certain factor will not translate to the same reduction in the total energy. A reader not familiar with such nuances (for example a typical member of the ML community), may be mislead by such claims. 
3. On a similar note as comment 2, the authors should explicitly mention that the claimed speedup is that of the floating point unit only, and it will not translate to the overall workload speedup. Although the speedup of the compute unit is roughly quadratic in the bit-width, the bandwidth requirements scale linearly with bit-width. As a result, it is possible that these custom floating point units may be starved on memory bandwidth, in which case the claims of speedup and energy savings need to be revisited.
4. The authors should also comment on the complexities and overheads introduced in data accesses, designing the various system buses/ data paths when the number representation is not byte-aligned. Moving to a custom 14-bit number representation (for example) can improve the performance and energy-efficiency of the floating point unit, but these gains can be partially eroded due to the additional overhead in supporting non-byte aligned memory accesses.

human,human,"The paper is a novel application for the sticky HDP-HMM, focused on correctly identifying the number of components in bird and whale song across a variety of datasets. It's nice to see the model applied to an interesting dataset. My main issues with the paper have to do with structure and the choice of representation used in the model. Namely:

The organization of the paper could be significantly improved. There is a lot of repetitive introduction that adds little to the paper. The first and last two sentences of the abstract could be cut. Many other parts of the abstract basically repeat the introduction. The second paragraph of section 2.3 also repeats your introduction - by now we know what you're doing. I think most people reading this will have no idea what Kershenbaum (2014) is. The description of the data should go in the experiments section. ""Different hypotheses for the songs were emitted"" in the introduction is odd phrasing. Figure 4 should be the first figure and go in the introduction. Figure 5 should be in the methods section. A summary of Table 1 should be in the experiments section. Generally the writing could be tightened quite a bit, which would make space for these figures. The description of the HDP-HMM, which mostly follows the existing literature, is well done.

Some general questions about the methods used:

If you're interested in scalable inference, why use Gibbs sampling? Why not the beam sampler (van Gael 2008), which at least recently was the state of the art for MCMC inference in the HDP-HMM? More generally, why use MCMC at all? For very large datasets, most of the Bayesian ML community has converged on stochastic variational inference as the most practical method (eg Wang, Paisley and Blei 2011).

If your interest is mainly in the number of clusters, how would you address the fact that DP mixture models are known not to be consistent for estimating the true number of clusters (Miller and Harrison 2013)?

MFCC features are calibrated to the human auditory system, not bird or whale auditory systems. In your data, do you calibrate the MFCC scale to be closer to the auditory systems of the animals that generated the song?

And a final suggestion for future work, which could use the results presented here as a baseline:

Given the success of LSTMs in speech recognition in recent years, it may be the case that deep learned representations are superior to linear features (like the means of each cluster in an HDP-HMM) for animal song as well. Have you considered a hybrid model, similar to recent work combining autoencoders and graphical models (Johnson, Duvenaud, Wiltschko, Datta and Adams 2016)?"
human,human,"The authors propose to measure “feature importance”, or specifically, which pixels contribute most to a network’s classification of an image. A simple (albeit not particularly effective) heuristic for measuring feature importance is to measure the gradients of the predicted class wrt each pixel in an input image I. This assigns a score to each pixel in I (that ranks how much the output prediction would change if a given pixel were to change). In this paper, the authors build on this and propose to measure feature importance by computing gradients of the output wrt scaled version of the input image, alpha*I, where alpha is a scalar between 0 and 1, then summing across all values of alpha to obtain their feature importance score. Here the scaling is simply linear scaling of the pixel values (alpha=0 is all black image, alpha=1 is original image). The authors call these scaled images “counterfactuals” which seems like quite an unnecessarily grandiose name for literally, a scaled image. 

The authors show a number of visualizations that indicate that the proposed feature importance score is more reasonable than just looking at gradients only with respect to the original image. They also show some quantitative evidence that the pixels highlighted by the proposed measure are more likely to fall on the objects rather than spurious parts of the image (in particular, see figure 5). The method is also applied to other types of networks. The quantitative evidence is quite limited and most of the paper is spent on qualitative results.

While the goal of understanding deep networks is of key importance, it is not clear whether this paper really help elucidate much. The main interesting observation in this paper is that scaling an image by a small alpha (i.e. creating a faint image) places more “importance” on pixels on the object related to the correct class prediction. Beyond that, the paper builds a bit on this, but no deeper insight is gained. The authors propose some hand-wavy explanation of why using small alpha (faint image) may force the network to focus on the object, but the argument is not convincing. It would have been interesting to try to probe a bit deeper here, but that may not be easy.

Ultimately, it is not clear how the proposed scheme for feature importance ranking is useful. First, it is still quite noisy and does not truly help understand what a deep net is doing on a particular image. Performing a single gradient descent step on an image (or on the collection of scaled versions of the image) hardly begins to probe the internal workings of a network. Moreover, as the authors admit, the scheme makes the assumption that each pixel is independent, which is clearly false.

Considering the paper presents a very simple idea, it is far too long. The main paper is 14 pages, up to 19 with references and appendix. In general the writing is long-winded and overly verbose. It detracted substantially from the paper. The authors also define unnecessary terminology. “Gradients of Coutnerfactuals” sounds quite fancy, but is not very related to the ideas explored in the writing. I would encourage the authors to tighten up the writing and figures down to a more readable page length, and to more clearly spell out the ideas explored early on."

**Title:** Unsupervised Discovery of Word-like Units from Continuous Speech Using Multimodal Learning

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The paper presents a novel methodology for discovering word-like units from continuous speech without relying on text transcriptions. This is a significant advancement in the field of unsupervised speech processing, as it addresses the limitations of traditional ASR systems that require extensive labeled data.

2. **Multimodal Learning:** By leveraging visual associations, the paper introduces a multimodal approach that enhances the discovery of linguistic units. This is a creative solution that mimics the way humans often learn language, associating words with visual stimuli.

3. **Scalability:** The proposed method runs in linear time (O(n)), which is a substantial improvement over previous methods with O(n^2) complexity. This scalability is demonstrated with a large dataset of over 522 hours of audio data, showcasing the method's potential for real-world applications.

4. **Comprehensive Evaluation:** The use of a large dataset from the Places205 dataset and the detailed description of the experimental setup provide a solid foundation for evaluating the proposed method. The use of a proxy ASR system for analysis, while not part of the learning process, adds an additional layer of validation.

5. **Detailed Methodology:** The paper provides a thorough explanation of the neural network architecture used for the multimodal embedding, including specific details about the convolutional layers and pooling strategies. This transparency allows for reproducibility and further exploration by other researchers.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Limited Language Evaluation:** Although the method is evaluated on an English corpus, the claim that it could be applied to any language is not empirically tested. Demonstrating the method's effectiveness on a diverse set of languages, especially those without a writing system, would strengthen the paper's claims.

2. **Dependence on Visual Data:** While the use of visual data is innovative, it may not always be feasible to have corresponding images for all spoken data, especially in real-world scenarios. The paper could discuss potential limitations or alternative approaches when visual data is unavailable.

3. **Proxy Transcripts for Analysis:** The reliance on Google's Speech Recognition API for generating proxy transcripts raises questions about the potential bias introduced by this system. The paper could benefit from a discussion on how these proxy transcripts might affect the analysis and interpretation of results.

base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents an exploration of representation learning, particularly focusing on the challenges and potential solutions in combining Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) with autoregressive models to achieve both powerful density estimation and effective representation learning. The authors propose a model that aims to balance these aspects, addressing the common issue where the autoregressive component dominates, rendering the latent variables unused.

### Strengths

1. **Clear Problem Statement**: The paper clearly identifies the problem of VAEs not always autoencoding effectively, especially when combined with powerful autoregressive models. This is a well-known issue in the field, and the paper's focus on this problem is relevant and timely.

2. **Comprehensive Background**: The introduction and technical background sections provide a thorough overview of the current state of representation learning, VAEs, and autoregressive models. This sets a solid foundation for understanding the challenges and the proposed solutions.

3. **Novel Insights**: The discussion on why VAEs do not always autoencode, particularly the insights into the role of the decoder's power and the Bits-Back Coding perspective, offers a fresh angle on the problem. This theoretical contribution is valuable for researchers looking to understand the limitations of current models.

4. **Empirical Results**: The paper claims state-of-the-art log-likelihood results on datasets like MNIST, OMNIGLOT, and Caltech-101, suggesting that the proposed model is not only theoretically sound but also practically effective.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Detailed Methodology**: While the paper discusses the problem and theoretical insights in depth, it lacks a detailed description of the proposed model and methodology. Readers would benefit from a clearer explanation of how the hybrid model is constructed and how it overcomes the identified challenges.

2. **Empirical Validation**: Although the paper mentions achieving state-of-the-art results, it does not provide detailed experimental setups, comparisons, or ablation studies. This makes it difficult to assess the robustness and generalizability of the results.

3. **Complexity and Scalability**: The paper does not address the computational complexity or scalability of the proposed model. Given the combination of VAEs and autoregressive models, it is important to discuss how the model performs in terms of training time and resource requirements.

4. **Clarity and Organization**: Some sections, particularly the discussion on Bits-Back Coding, are dense and may be difficult for readers unfamiliar with the concept. The paper could benefit from clearer explanations and possibly visual aids to enhance understanding.

human,human,"This paper proposed a set of different things under the name of ""sampling generative models"", focusing on analyzing the learned latent space and synthesizing desirable output images with certain properties for GANs.  This paper does not have one single clear message or idea, but rather proposed a set of techniques that seem to produce visually good looking results.  While this paper has some interesting ideas, it also has a number of problems.

The spherical interpolation idea is interesting, but after a second thought this does not make much sense.  The proposed slerp interpolation equation (page 2) implicitly assumes that the two points q1 and q2 lie on the same sphere, in which case the parameter theta is the angle corresponding to the great arc connecting the two points on the sphere.  However, the latent space of a GAN, no matter trained with a uniform distribution or a Gaussian distribution, is not a distribution on a sphere, and many points have different distances to the origin.  The author's justification for this comes from the well known fact that in high dimensional space, even with a uniform distribution most points lie on a thin shell in the unit cube.  This is true because in high-dimensional space, the outer shell takes up most of the volume in space, and the inner part takes only a very small fraction of the space, in terms of volume.  This does not mean the density of data in the outer shell is greater than the inner part, though.  In a uniform distribution, the data density should be equal everywhere, a point on the outer shell is not more likely than a point in the inner part.  Under a Gaussian model, the data density is on the other hand higher in the center and much lower on the out side.  If we have a good model of data, then sampling the most likely points from the model should give us plausible looking samples.  In this sense, spherical interpolation should do no better than the normally used linear interpolation.  From the questions and answers it seems that the author does not recognize this distinction.  The results shown in this paper seem to indicate that spherical interpolation is better visually, but it is rather hard to make any concrete conclusions from three pairs of examples.  If this is really the case then there must be something else wrong about our understanding of the learned model.

Aside from these, the J-diagram and the nearest neighbor latent space traversal both seems to be good ways to explore the latent space of a learned model.  The attribute vector section on transforming images to new ones with desired attributes is also interesting, and it provides a few new ways to make the GAN latent space more interpretable.

Overall I feel most of the techniques proposed in this paper are nice visualization tools.  The contributions however, are mostly on the design of the visualizations, and not much on the technical and model side.  The spherical interpolation provides the only mathematical equation in the paper, yet the correctness of the technique is arguable.  For the visualization tools, there are also no quantitative evaluation, maybe these results are more art than science."
human,human,"Dear Reviewers & AC:

We'd like to thank all the reviewers & commenters for their useful suggestions. By taking into account discussion so far, we have significantly updated the manuscript to address questions/concerns.

Minor clarification questions have been answered in discussion below. Here we summarize the main concerns of reviewers and subsequently explain how our latest revision address these concerns:

*** Larger scale experiments (Reviewer1, Reviewer3)
This is the main focus of the latest revision. In Section 4.3 of the latest revision, we have shown:
1. VLAE has the current best density estimation performance on CIFAR10 among latent-code models. It also outperforms PixelCNN/PixelRNN [1] and is only second to PixelCNN++ [2].
2. We show several different ways to encode different kinds of information into latent code to demonstrate that one can similarly control information placement on CIFAR10.

*** ""the necessity of ""crippling"" the decoder ... has already been pointed out"" (Reviewer1)
Thanks for making the distinction clear. We have revised relevant text (last paragraph of introduction for example) to highlight that the analysis of ""why crippling is necessary"" is our main contribution as opposed to ""pointing out it's necessary"" [3].

*** ""However, they never actually showed how a VAE without AF prior but that has a PixelCNN decoder performs. What would be the impact on the latent code is no AF prior is used?"" (Reviewer2)
Thanks for your suggestion and we have added related experiments in Appendix. C (edit: should be Appendix. D) of the latest revision of the paper. These experiments show removing AF prior will result in worse performance and make the latent code carry less information.

Next we briefly summarize additional contributions in the latest revision.

In the initial revision, we hypothesized that by improving VAE training procedure, VLAE's modelling performance can be improved. In initial experiments, we used the “free-bits” technique [5] and this turned out to create optimization challenges. In the latest revision, we proposed a new technique ""soft free-bits"" (described in Appendix.C) which has resulted in more robust optimization. 

We also investigated replacing ResNet VAEs [4,5] with DenseNet [6] VAEs and this change reduces overfitting. “Soft free-bits” and DenseNet VAEs are novel changes and enable VLAE models to outperform previous latent-code models like ResNet VAE w/ IAF [5] as well as competitive autoregressive density estimators like PixelRNN [1] on CIFAR10. These techniques are not unique to VLAE and we suspect they will also be useful to other types of VAEs.

We also have added one more way to separate information -- by restricting the PixelCNN decoder to condition only on grayscale image, a lossy latent code can be forced to learn color information.

We believe we have addressed reviewers' concerns and overall strengthened this submission. We hope reviewers can take a look at the latest revision and possibly adjust rating in light of new evidence.

We are happy to answer any additional questions!

---------------------------------------------------------

PS: We also plan to include experiments with 64x64 datasets but due to time constraints we haven't been able to finish them in time for inclusion in the current revision. We will include them in a later version and release all code when experiments are finished.

human,human,"We first thank all the reviewers for the interesting comments they provided. All three reviewers agree on the potential importance of the proposed algorithm, but they also suggest that more experimental data are needed to demonstrate that GA3C achieves results in the same ballpark as the original A3C. This turns out to be particularly important in the light of the fact that the policy lag in GA3C can potentially introduce instabilities, as noted by Reviewer #1.

We have included a better description of this in Section 4.4 of the revised paper, as well as analyzed it in a newly added Section 5.3, while providing additional experiments to verify the game performance of GA3C and its stability. As pointed out by the reviewers and already highlighted in the paper, establishing a validation protocol that allows comparing the final scores achieved by GA3C with the scores achieved by other training algorithms is complex or even infeasible, as many implementation details are not shared, as well as validation protocols are poorly reproducible. Beyond that, the final score (still reported in Table 3) tells only part of the story, and therefore we espouse the idea shared by Reviewer #1 and #3 of reporting learning curves as a function of the time. The newly added Fig. 6 and 7 show the learning curves for GA3C and several games as a function of the time. The reader can easily compare these graphs with those reported in Mnih’s paper, as well as in other venues mentioned by the reviewers (e.g. github). The score vs. time curves show a similar dynamic for GA3C and A3C, although it is also important mentioning that curves reported in Mnih’s paper represent the average of the top 5 curves in a set of 50 with various learning rates, which we are unable to match due limitations in available computational resources. Since systems, system loads, environments and hyper-parameters are so widely varying, we also believe that releasing the GA3C code (which we plan to do in the next days) will allow other researchers to systematically evaluate the performances of GA3C and facilitate a fair comparison with new techniques.

Reviewer #1’s main concern is about instabilities introduced in GA3C. The training curves reported in the paper indeed show a few instabilities occurring in the training process, but these represent a common phenomenon in RL. Beyond analyzing in Section 4.4 how the policy lag in GA3C can generate these instabilities, we now show experimentally that such instabilities do not affect some games (e.g. Pong), while they can invalidate the learning process in other ones (e.g. Breakout), especially in the case of a large learning rate (Fig. 7 and 8). We found that properly tuning the algorithm hyper-parameters (and in particular the learning rate) dramatically limits the effect of instabilities on the learning process. GA3C would likely benefit from a thorough learning rate search as presented in Mnih’s paper over a set of 50 different learning rates for A3C. Beyond this, we also show how batching on training data (see the newly introduced Section 5.3, and Fig. 7 and 8 in particular) can be used to limit the effect of these instabilities, at the price of a slower convergence rate.

Specific answers to the individual reviewers follow.

===============================
Reviewer 1
===============================

We agree with the reviewer that instabilities may affect the learning process. This is indeed a commonly observed phenomenon in RL. Given the fact that GA3C and A3C are indeed (slightly) different algorithms (as now clearly explained in Section 4.4 of the paper), we followed the reviewer’s suggestion and performed a thorough evaluation of the instabilities of the learning process on several games. Experimental results are reported in Section 5.3 and in Fig. 7 and 8 in particular. These show that, for some games (e.g. Pong), the delayed computation of the gradient terms in GA3C (see Section 4.4) does not introduce convergence issues, that are however present in other games (e.g. Breakout). However, a proper selection of the algorithm hyper-parameters, and of the learning rate in particular, is sufficient to achieve results that are comparable to those achieved by A3C (see Table 3). Quite interestingly, the optimal learning rate for GA3C results to be smaller than the one reported in Mnih’s paper for A3C (as it can be seen in Fig. 6) - this somehow confirms that A3C and GA3C are indeed slightly different algorithms, and GA3C requires careful parameter tuning to obtain optimal results. We also demonstrated that batching of the training data can be used to limit the instabilities, at the price of a slower convergence rate.

===============================
Reviewer 2
===============================

Following the suggestion of the other two reviewers, and sharing the conviction that replicating the Deep Mind evaluation protocol is non-trivial, we now report in the paper more training curves for several games (Fig. 6) as a function of the training time. This allows the reader to perform a direct comparison between our training curves and the ones reported in Mnih’s paper, independently from the hardware system used for training. Although, the reader should be careful about this comparison since Mnih’s graphs show top 5 out of 50 runs which is hard to compare with the small number of runs considered in Fig. 6. These curves demonstrate that training time is comparable while achieving a similar training score. The analysis of the theoretical discrepancies between A3C and GA3C (Section 4.4) and its experimental evaluation in terms of instabilities (Section 5.3) should also serve to clarify that, once the hyper-parameters are properly set, GA3C is comparable to A3C in terms of performance.
As for the question about the protocol used for evaluation the score of our trained agents, we now better specify in the caption of table 3 and in the text that we are reporting the average score over 30 different runs for the best agent we trained with GA3C. A direct comparison using the protocol followed in Mnih’s paper is not feasible, as the authors did not share the “human start condition” for each game.

===============================
Reviewer 3
===============================

We agree with the reviewer that showing score vs. time plot would be more informative than reporting only the final score as in Table 3. Therefore, we added Fig. 6 to the paper, showing that, with the proper selection of the hyper-parameters, the dynamic of the learning curves of GA3C is similar to that shown in the original A3C paper by Mnih et al. We believe that other, more precise comparisons in terms of learning speed require an optimized implementation as well as a broad hyper-parameter search (in the style of the original A3C plot, showing top 5 results among a set of 50 learners trained with different learning rates), which is out of the scope for this paper. We also decided to keep Table 3 in the paper - although, as explicitly mentioned in the paper, this information is approximate, it gives an idea that GA3C and A3C achieves final score in the same ballpark.
We also suggest that the contribution of our paper is not limited to the implementation of GA3C, but it also includes the analysis of the computational aspects of GA3C and other RL algorithms that can be implemented through a similar architecture. This contribution stands independently from the potential stability issues for GA3C, while the proposed architecture (and the freely available code) can be modified or extended to address these issues, improve the convergence speed, or attack real world problems."

**Title:** PixelVAE: A Latent Variable Model Combining VAEs and PixelCNNs

**Summary:**
The paper introduces PixelVAE, a novel generative model that combines the strengths of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and PixelCNNs. The model aims to address the limitations of VAEs in capturing fine details and the computational inefficiency of PixelCNNs. PixelVAE incorporates PixelCNN-based masked convolutions in the VAE's decoder, allowing for autoregressive modeling of output pixels. The paper also extends PixelVAE to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers, demonstrating its effectiveness on datasets like MNIST, ImageNet, and LSUN bedrooms.

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Approach:** The combination of VAEs and PixelCNNs is a novel approach that leverages the strengths of both models. This hybrid model addresses the limitations of each individual model effectively.

2. **Hierarchical Extension:** The extension to a hierarchical model with multiple stochastic layers is a significant contribution. It allows for more complex modeling of data, capturing both global and local structures efficiently.

3. **Empirical Results:** The paper provides strong empirical results, showing that PixelVAE achieves state-of-the-art likelihood on MNIST and competitive performance on more challenging datasets like ImageNet and LSUN bedrooms.

4. **Computational Efficiency:** By using fewer PixelCNN layers and relying on latent variables for global structure, PixelVAE reduces computational costs compared to standard PixelCNN implementations.

human,human,"This paper presents a modified gated RNN caled GRU-D that deals with time series which display a lot of missing values in their input. They work on two fronts. The first deals with the missing inputs directly by using a learned convex combination of the previous available value (forward imputation) and the mean value (mean imputation). The second includes dampening the recurrent layer not unlike a second reset gate, but parametrized according to the time elapsed since the last available value of each attributes.

Positives
------------
- Clear definition of the task (handling missing values for classification of time series)
- Many interesting baselines to test the new model against.
- The model presented deals with the missing values in a novel, ML-type way (learn new dampening parameters).
- The extensive tests done on the datasets is probably the greatest asset of this paper.

Negatives
-------------
- The paper could use some double checking for typos.
- The Section A.2.3 really belongs in the main article as it deals with important related works. Swap it with the imprecise diagrams of the model if you need space.
- No mention of any methods from the statistics litterature.

Here are the two main points of this review that informs my decision:

1. The results, while promising, are below expectations. The paper hasn’t been able to convince me that GRU-simple (without intervals) isn’t just as well-suited for the task of handling missing inputs as GRU-D. In the main paper, GRU-simple is presented as the main baseline. Yet, it includes a lot of extraneous parameters (the intervals) that, according to Table 5, probably hurts the model more than it helps it. Having a third of it’s parameters being of dubious value, it brings the question of the fairness of the comparison done in the main paper, especially since in the one table where GRU-simple (without intervals) is present, GRU-D doesn’t significantly outperforms it.

2. My second concern, and biggest, is with some claims that are peppered through the paper. The first is about the relationship with the presence rate of data in the dataset and the diagnostics. I might be wrong, but that only indicates that the doctor in charge of that patient requested the relevant analyses be done according to the patient’s condition. That would mean that an expert system based on this data would always seem to be one step behind. 
The second claim is the last sentence of the introduction, which sets huge expectations that were not met by the paper. Another is that “simply concatenating masking and time interval vectors fails to exploit the temporal structure of missing values” is unsubstantiated and actually disproven later in the paper. 
Yet another is the conclusion that since GRU models displayed the best improvement between a subsample of the dataset and the whole of it means that the improvement is going to continue to grow as more data is added. This fails to consider that non-GRU models actually started with much better results than most GRU ones. 
Lastly is their claim to capture informative missingness by incorporating masking and time intervals directly inside the GRU architecture. While the authors did make these changes, the fact that they also concatenate the mask to the input, just like GRU-simple (without intervals), leads me to question the actual improvement made by GRU-D. 

Given that, while I find that the work that has been put into the paper is above average, I wouldn’t accept that paper without a reframing of the findings and a better focus on the real contribution of this paper, which I believe is the novel way to parametrize the choice of imputation method."

- Constraints inherent to the output space are incorporated well into the
model. 
- Good evaluation and comparisons; also showing how the different aspects of
the model impact performance.
- Clearly written paper.

Weaknesses:
- My primary and only major issue with the paper is the evaluation metrics.
While accuracy and BLEU4 are easy to compute, I don't think they give a
sufficiently complete picture.                          Accuracy can easily miss
correctly
generated
code because of trivial (and for program functionality, inconsequential)
changes.  You could get 0% accuracy with 100% functional correctness.  As for
BLEU, I'm not sure how well it evaluates code where you can perform significant
changes (e.g., tree transformations of the AST) without changing functionality.
 I understand why BLEU is being used, but it seems to me to be particularly
problematic given its token level n-gram evaluation.  Perhaps BLEU can be
applied to the ASTs of both reference code and generated code after some level
of normalization of the ASTs?  What I would really like to see is an evaluation
testing for functional equivalence of reference and generated code. 
Understandably this is difficult since test code will have to be written for
each reference.  However, even if this is done for a random (reasonably small)
subsample of the datasets, I think it would give a much more meaningful
picture. 

Minor issues:
- Page 2, para 2: ""structural information helps to model information flow
within the network"": by ""network"", do you mean the AST?

- Section 4.2.1, Action Embedding: Are the action embedding vectors in W_R and
W_G simply one-hot vectors or do you actually have a non-trivial embedding for
the actions?  If so, how is it computed?  If not, what is the difference
between the vectors of W_R and e(r) in equation 4?

- Section 5.2, Preprocessing:  If you replace quoted strings in the
descriptions for the DJANGO dataset, how are cases where those strings need to
be copied into the generated code handled?  It is also mentioned (in the
supplementary material) that infrequent words are filtered out.  If so, how do
you handles cases where those words describe the variable name or a literal
that needs to be in the code?

**Strengths:**

1. **Simplicity and Elegance:** The proposed method, prototypical networks, is based on a simple yet effective idea of representing each class by a single prototype, which is the mean of the support set in an embedding space. This simplicity makes the approach easy to implement and computationally efficient.

2. **Competitive Performance:** Despite its simplicity, the method achieves competitive results compared to more complex models like matching networks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the inductive bias introduced by the prototypical representation.

3. **Episodic Training:** The use of episodic training, which mimics the test environment during training, is a strong point. This approach has been shown to improve the generalization of models in few-shot learning tasks.

human,human,"- Strengths:

The authors present a novel adaptation of encoder-decoder neural MT using an
approach that starts and ends with characters, but in between works with
representations of morphemes and characters. 

The authors release both their code as well as their final learned models for
fr-en, cs-en, and en-cs. This is helpful in validating their work, as well as
for others looking to replicate and extends this work.

The system reported appears to produce translation results of reasonable
quality even after the first training epoch, with continued progress in future
epochs.

The system appears to learn reasonable morphological tokenizations, and appears
able to handle previously unseen words (even nonce words) by implicitly backing
off to morphemes.

- Weaknesses:

In the paper, the authors do not explicitly state which WMT test and dev sets
their results are reported on. This is problematic for readers wishing to
compare the reported results to existing work (for example, the results at
matrix.statmt.org). The only way this reviewer found to get this information
was to look in the README of the code supplement, which indicates that the test
set was newstest2015 and the dev test was newstest2013. This should have been
explicitly described in the paper.

The instructions given in the software README are OK, but not great. The
training and testing sections each could be enhanced with explicit examples of
how to run the respective commands. The software itself should respond to a
--help flag, which it currently does not.

The paper describes a 6-level architecture, but the diagram in Figure 2 appears
to show fewer than 6 layers. What's going on? The caption should be more
explicit, and if this figure is not showing all of the layers, then there
should be a figure somewhere (even if it's in an appendix) showing all of the
layers.

The results show comparison to other character-based neural systems, but do not
show state-of-the-art results for other types of MT system. WMT (and
matrix.statmt.org) has reported results for other systems on these datasets,
and it appears that the state-of-the-art is much higher than any of the results
reported in this paper. That should be acknowledged, and ideally should be
discussed.

There are a handful of minor English disfluencies, misspellings, and minor
LaTeX issues, such as reverse quotation marks. These should be corrected.

base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel framework called the Manager-Programmer-Computer (MPC) for neural program induction, specifically applied to semantic parsing. The framework aims to leverage the memory and discrete operations of traditional computers to address the challenges of training neural networks with weak supervision. The paper introduces the Neural Symbolic Machine (NSM), which integrates a sequence-to-sequence model with a non-differentiable Lisp interpreter to execute programs against a large knowledge base.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Framework**: The MPC framework is a creative approach to integrating neural networks with traditional computing paradigms. By using a manager, programmer, and computer, the framework effectively addresses the challenge of non-differentiable operations in training.

2. **Weak Supervision**: The paper tackles the problem of weak supervision, which is crucial for scaling semantic parsing tasks. The use of a reward-based system to guide the programmer is a practical solution to the lack of annotated data.

3. **Technical Contributions**: The paper makes several technical contributions, including the use of key-variable memory to support language compositionality and the integration of REINFORCE with an iterative maximum likelihood process. These innovations help in overcoming the search problem and improving training efficiency.

4. **State-of-the-Art Results**: The NSM achieves state-of-the-art results on the WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The end-to-end training without the need for feature engineering is a significant advantage.

5. **Clear Problem Definition**: The paper clearly defines the semantic parsing task and the challenges associated with it, providing a solid foundation for the proposed solution.

### Weaknesses

1. **Complexity**: The proposed framework, while innovative, is quite complex. The integration of multiple components (manager, programmer, computer) and the use of both REINFORCE and maximum likelihood training may be difficult to implement and understand for practitioners.

2. **Limited Evaluation**: The evaluation is primarily focused on the WEBQUESTIONSSP dataset. It would be beneficial to see how the framework performs on other datasets or tasks to assess its generalizability.

3. **Scalability Concerns**: While the paper claims scalability due to weak supervision, the actual scalability of the system in terms of computational resources and time is not thoroughly discussed. The use of a Lisp interpreter and large knowledge bases may introduce bottlenecks.

*- Task
*- Simple model, yet the best results on SQuAD (single model0
*- Evaluation and comparison

- Weaknesses:
*- Analysis of errors/results (See detailed comments below)

- General Discussion:
In this paper the authors present a method for directly querying Wikipedia to
answer open domain questions. The system consist of two components - a module
to query/fetch wikipedia articles and a module to answer the question given the
fetched set of wikipedia articles. 

The document retrieval system is a traditional IR system relying on term
frequency models and ngram counts.  The answering system uses a feature
representation for paragraphs that consists of word embeddings, indicator
features to determine whether a paragraph word occurs in a question,
token-level features including POS, NER etc and a soft feature for capturing
similarity between question and paragraph tokens in embedding space. A combined
feature representation is used as an input to a bi-direction LSTM RNN for
encoding. For questions an RNN that works on the word embeddings is used. 
These are then used to train an overall classifier independently for start and
end spans of sentences within a paragraph to answer questions.

The system has been trained using different Open Domain QA datasets such as
SQuAD and WebQuestions by modifying the training data to include articles
fetched by the IR engine instead of just the actual correct document/passage.

Overall, an easy to follow interesting paper but I had a few questions:
1) The IR system has a Accuracy@5 of over 75 %, and individually the document
reader performs well and can beat the best single models on SquAD. What
explains the significant drop in Table 6. The authors mention that instead of
the fetched results, if they test using the best paragraph the accuracy reaches
just 0.49 (from 0.26) but that is still significantly below the 0.78-79 in the
SQuAD task.  So, presumably the error is this large because the neural network
for matching isnt doing as good a job in learning the answers when using the
modified training set (which includes fetched articles) instead of the case
when training and testing is done for the document understanding task. Some
analysis of whats going on here should be provided. What was the training
accuracy in the both cases? What can be done to improve it? To be fair, the
authors to allude to this in the conclusion but I think it still needs to be
part of the paper to provide some meaningful insights.

2) I understand the authors were interested in treating this as a pure machine
comprehension task and therefore did not want to rely on external sources such
as Freebase which could have helped with entity typing        but that would have
been interesting to use. Tying back to my first question -- if the error is due
to highly relevant topical sentences as the authors mention, could entity
typing have helped?

The authors should also refer to QuASE (Sun et. al 2015 at WWW2015) and similar
systems in their related work. QuASE is also an Open domain QA system that
answers using fetched passages - but it relies on the web instead of just
Wikipedia."

The Q-function is updated using the following update rule: Q(s, a) ← Q(s, a) + α[R + γQ(s′, a′) − Q(s, a)], where α is the learning rate, γ is the discount factor, and s′ and a′ are the next state and action, respectively. The policy πM is updated using the following update rule: πM(s) ← πM(s) + β[Q(s, πM(s)) − Q(s, πM(s))], where β is the policy update rate. The metacontroller agent aM is trained using a batch of tasks, and the policy πM is updated after each task. The performance of the metacontroller agent aM is evaluated using the cumulative reward R over a sequence of tasks. The results show that the metacontroller agent aM can learn to optimize task performance and computational cost, and outperforms traditional optimization methods in terms of task performance and computational cost. The results also show that the metacontroller agent aM can adapt to changing task requirements and computational resources. The paper concludes by discussing the potential applications of the metacontroller agent aM in real-world scenarios, such as robotics, autonomous vehicles, and healthcare. Please provide a detailed review of the above paper, including its strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.

#### Strengths

1. **Novelty and Relevance**: The paper addresses an interesting and relevant question in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and cognitive science: how different writing tasks influence writing style. This is a novel angle that adds depth to the understanding of writing style beyond personal and psychological factors.

2. **Methodology**: The use of the ROC story cloze task as a case study is well-justified. The task's design, which involves writing coherent and incoherent story endings, provides a clear framework for analyzing stylistic differences. The paper effectively leverages this dataset to explore the impact of task constraints on writing style.

3. **Empirical Results**: The paper presents strong empirical results, demonstrating that a linear classifier can distinguish between different types of story endings with significant accuracy. The improvement over the state-of-the-art in the story cloze task is noteworthy, indicating the practical utility of the proposed approach.

4. **Contributions**: The paper makes three clear contributions: insights into cognitive load and writing style, implications for NLP task design, and a new state-of-the-art result on the story cloze challenge. These contributions are well-articulated and supported by the findings.

5. **Integration with Neural Models**: The combination of stylistic features with neural language models to enhance performance on the story cloze task is a valuable contribution. It shows the potential for integrating traditional linguistic features with modern machine learning approaches.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper could benefit from improved organization and clarity. The introduction is somewhat dense, and the transition between sections is not always smooth. For instance, the jump from discussing the influence of writing tasks on style to the specifics of the ROC story cloze task could be more seamless.

2. **Limited Discussion on Cognitive Processes**: While the paper mentions cognitive processes, it does not delve deeply into how these processes might specifically influence writing style. A more detailed discussion on the cognitive mechanisms at play would strengthen the theoretical foundation of the study.

3. **Lack of Qualitative Analysis**: The paper primarily focuses on quantitative results. Including a qualitative analysis of the stylistic differences observed in the writing tasks could provide richer insights and make the findings more interpretable.

4. **Generalizability**: The study is based on a specific dataset and task. While the results are promising, the paper could discuss the generalizability of the findings to other writing tasks and datasets. This would"

**Title:** Modifications to PixelCNN for Improved Performance

**Strengths:**

1. **Innovative Modifications:** The paper presents several innovative modifications to the original PixelCNN model, which are well-motivated and address specific limitations of the original architecture. The use of a discretized logistic mixture likelihood is a particularly noteworthy improvement, as it addresses the inefficiencies and sparsity issues associated with the 256-way softmax used in the original model.

2. **Comprehensive Explanation:** The authors provide a detailed explanation of their modifications, including the mathematical formulations and the reasoning behind each change. This clarity helps readers understand the potential benefits of the proposed changes.

human,human,"This paper proposes a cascade of paired (left/right, up/down) 1D RNNs as a module in CNNs in order to quickly add global context information to features without the need for stacking many convolutional layers. Experimental results are presented on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.

Pros:
- The paper is very clear and easy to read.
- Enough details are given that the paper can likely be reproduced with or without source code.
- Using 1D RNNs inside CNNs is a topic that deserves more experimental exploration than what exists in the literature.

Cons (elaborated on below):
(1) Contributions relative to, e.g. Bell et al., are minor.
(2) Disappointed in the actual use of the proposed L-RNN module versus how it's sold in the intro.
(3) Classification experiments are not convincing.

(1,2): The introduction states w.r.t. Bell et al. ""more substantial differences are two fold: first, we treat the L-RNN module as a general block, that can be inserted into any layer of a modern architecture, such as into a residual module. Second, we show (section 4) that the
L-RNN can be formulated to be inserted into a pre-trained FCN (by initializing with zero recurrence
matrices), and that the entire network can then be fine-tuned end-to-end.""

I felt positive about these contributions after reading the intro, but then much less so after reading the experimental sections. Based on the first contribution (""general block that can be inserted into any layer""), I strongly expected to see the L-RNN block integrated throughout the CNN starting from near the input. However, the architectures for classification and segmentation only place the module towards the very end of the network. While not exactly the same as Bell et al. (there are many technical details that differ), it is close. The paper does not compare to the design from Bell et al. Is there any advantage to the proposed design? Or is it a variation that performs similarly? What happens if L-RNN is integrated earlier in the network, as suggested by the introduction?

The second difference is a bit more solid, but still does not rise to a 'substantive difference' in my view. Note that Bell et al. also integrate 1D RNNs into an ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 model. I do, however, think that the method of integration proposed in this paper (zero initialization) may be more elegant and does not require two-stage training by first freezing the lower layers and then later unfreezing them.

(3) I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too). The issue is that CIFAR-10 is not interesting as a task unto itself *and* methods that work well on CIFAR-10 do not necessarily generalize to other tasks. ImageNet has been useful because, thus far, it produces features that generalize well to other tasks. Showing good results on ImageNet is much more likely to demonstrate a model that learns generalizable features. However, that is not even necessarily true, and ideally I would like to see that that a model that does well on ImageNet in fact transfers its benefit to at least one other ask (e.g., detection).

One additional issue with the CIFAR experiments is that I expect to see a direct comparison of models A-F with and without L-RNN. It is hard to understand from the presented results if L-RNN actually adds much. In sum, I have a hard time taking away any valuable information from the CIFAR experiments.

Minor suggestion:
- Figure 4 is hard to read. The pixelated rounded corners on the yellow boxes are distracting."

**Title:** The paper does not provide a title, but it appears to focus on the development of a Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (GCRN) for modeling and predicting time-varying graph-based data.

**Strengths:**

1. **Relevance and Novelty:** The paper addresses a significant and timely problem in the field of machine learning, specifically the modeling of spatio-temporal sequences on graphs. This is a novel approach as it combines the strengths of CNNs and RNNs in a graph-based context, which is less explored compared to regular grid-based data.

2. **Comprehensive Background:** The introduction and preliminaries sections provide a thorough background on the existing methods for spatio-temporal sequence modeling, including CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, and graph-based CNNs. This sets a solid foundation for understanding the proposed GCRN model.

3. **Integration of Concepts:** The paper effectively integrates concepts from different domains (e.g., language modeling, graph theory, and neural networks) to propose a unified model for structured sequence modeling on graphs. This interdisciplinary approach is commendable.

4. **Technical Depth:** The paper delves into the technical details of LSTMs and graph CNNs, providing equations and explanations that demonstrate a deep understanding of these models. This is crucial for readers who wish to understand the intricacies of the proposed GCRN model.

**Weaknesses:**

1. **Lack of Experimental Results:** The paper does not provide any experimental results or evaluations of the proposed GCRN model. This is a significant omission, as empirical validation is essential to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the model.

2. **Clarity and Organization:** While the paper is technically detailed, it could benefit from clearer organization and presentation. For instance, the transition from the introduction to the preliminaries is abrupt, and the paper lacks a clear outline of the proposed GCRN model's architecture and its components.

#### Strengths

1. **Relevance and Timeliness**: The paper addresses a highly relevant topic in the field of deep learning, focusing on the efficiency of DNN computations through customized precision hardware. Given the increasing size and complexity of neural networks, this research is timely and significant.

2. **Comprehensive Exploration**: The paper explores a wide spectrum of customized precision settings for both fixed-point and floating-point representations. This comprehensive approach allows for a thorough understanding of the trade-offs involved in precision customization.

3. **Practical Implications**: The findings have direct implications for the design of DNN infrastructure, suggesting that floating-point representations may be more efficient than fixed-point for certain large-scale networks. This insight could influence future hardware design decisions.

4. **Novel Technique**: The paper introduces a novel technique to efficiently search the large customized precision design space, leveraging activations in the last layer to predict accuracy. This method is innovative and could be a valuable tool for DNN infrastructure designers.

5. **Empirical Validation**: The study evaluates its hypotheses on large, state-of-the-art neural networks like GoogLeNet and VGG, providing empirical evidence to support its claims. This strengthens the validity of the conclusions drawn.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Detailed Methodology**: While the paper introduces a novel technique for searching the precision design space, it lacks detailed methodological explanations. More information on how the model predicts accuracy based on last-layer activations would be beneficial.

2. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of its approach. For instance, the potential impact of customized precision on training time, energy consumption, and hardware costs could be explored further.

3. **Assumptions and Generalizations**: The paper assumes that findings from large-scale networks can be generalized across different architectures and applications. This assumption may not hold true in all cases, and a discussion on the scope and limitations of these generalizations would be helpful.

4. **Figures and Diagrams**: The paper includes figures (e.g., Figure 1 and Figure 2) that are not well-integrated into the text. These figures could be better explained and referenced to enhance understanding.

5. **Literature Review**: The literature review is somewhat limited, focusing primarily on a few key studies. A broader review of related work, including recent advancements in precision optimization and hardware design, would provide a more comprehensive context.

human,human,"We thank the reviewers for their time, but disagree with many points in the reviews.  We first address what we feel is the overall disconnect between the reviews and the contributions of the paper, then rebut specific points below.

Machine learning research is a mix of engineering, mathematics, and science.  Complete focus on engineering can restrict one to the narrow view of judging work by counting parameters and fractions of a percent in accuracy.  The reviews unfortunately reflect this mode of thinking.  However, long-term progress also requires scientific advancement, including new ideas as well as experiments that enhance understanding by revealing simple principles underlying complex phenomena.

FractalNet is a new idea with:

(1) Explanatory power:

As stated in the abstract, our experiments show that for the success of very deep networks, the ""key may be the ability to transition, during training, from effectively shallow to deep"".  This is the property shared by ResNet and FractalNet.

Furthermore, this observation is an important counterpoint to [Veit et al., NIPS 2016] which claims that: (a) ensemble-like behavior is key and (b) the fraction of available effectively short paths is somehow related to performance.  FractalNet provides a counterexample: we can extract a single column (plain network topology with one long path) and it alone (no ensembling) performs as well the entire network.  In FractalNet, the rest of the network is a training apparatus for transitioning from shallow to deep.  This strongly suggests that, with more careful analysis, the same may be true for ResNet.

In fact, unlike [Veit et al., NIPS 2016] our explanation is consistent with the view that very deep networks, such as ResNet and FractalNet, learn unrolled iterative estimation [Greff et al., Highway and Residual Networks learn Unrolled Iterative Estimation, arXiv:1612.07771 and ICLR 2017 submission].  In this view, the longest path is most important; the ensemble can be discarded after training.  Moreover, our Section 4.3 and Figure 3 provide insight into the dynamics of this learning process.

We believe that the research community values understanding these mechanisms and would benefit from the evidence our work injects into the debate.

(2) Simplifying power:

FractalNet shows how a simple design principle produces structure similar to the mishmash of hacks (hand-designed modules, manually-attached auxiliary losses at intermediate depths) required in prior architectures like Inception.  It also expands the set of simple tricks for building very deep networks to include an option other than residual connections.

(3) Good performance:

FractalNet matches a ResNet of equal depth in terms of performance on ImageNet.  Training either of these networks from scratch takes weeks on modern GPUs.  Yet, because FractalNet uses slightly more parameters or does not beat the absolute best ResNet variant (developed after 7 or so papers iterating on ResNet) on the smaller and less important CIFAR dataset, the reviews declare experiments unsatisfactory.  There is a line between demanding high experimental standards and strangling promising ideas; we are all for the former, but hope not to fall victim to the latter.

(4) New capabilities:

Contrary to AnonReviewer2's claim, prior work does not demonstrate an anytime property for ResNet; see our specific response below.  FractalNet, in combination with drop-path training, provides a novel anytime output capability, which could prove useful in real-world latency sensitive applications.


-----
Response to AnonReviewer1

Please see our comments about experiments above.

> Therefore the empirical effectiveness of drop-path is not convincing too.

Drop-path serves two purposes: (a) additional regularization in the absence of data augmentation and (b) regularization that allows the resulting network to have the anytime property.  Yes, additional data augmentation can compensate for drop-path if one only cares about (a), but drop-path is essential for and the only effective means of enabling anytime output.

> DenseNets (Huang et al, 2016a) should be also included in the comparison

DenseNet cites FractalNet as the original version of FractalNet (arXiv:1605.07648) was published on arXiv three months prior to the original version of DenseNet (arXiv:1608.06993).  We are happy to alert readers to subsequent work, but please keep in mind the historical sequence of development.

> Table 1 has Res-Net variants as baselines however Table 2 has only ResNet.

Many of the variants only reported results on CIFAR/SVHN.  For example, the Wide Residual Networks paper (arXiv:1605.07146), at the time of the ICLR deadline (November 5), did not include ImageNet results.  It was updated weeks later, on November 28, to include ImageNet results.  We can expand the table, but it is a bit difficult to have already compared to results that did not exist at submission time.

> there is no improvement in SVHN dataset results and this is not discussed in the empirical analysis.

Section 4.2 observes ""most methods perform similarly on SVHN"".  The errors rates on SVHN are so low as to be uninformative.  We believe SVHN is simply too easy of a dataset to be a challenge to any of the modern techniques in Table 1.  Much like MNIST, SVHN is now a useful sanity check, but not a differentiator.

> Also, authors give a list of some improvements over Inception (Szegedy et al., 2015) but again these intuitive claims about effectiveness of these changes are not supported with any empirical analysis.

Our point is merely to draw connections between the FractalNet architecture and some hand-designed components of Inception, suggesting a more fundamental explanation for why those particular hand-designed choices are effective.  Widespread adoption of ResNet by the community has displaced Inception, VGG, and other architectures, making ResNet the clear leader and appropriate target for experimental comparison.


-----
Response to AnonReviewer2

Please see our comments about experiments and the main contributions of the paper above.

> The 40 layer Fractal Net should not be compared to other models unless the parameter reduction tricks are utilized for the other models as well.

We are demonstrating feasibility of parameter reduction tricks for FractalNet.  Much of the iterative improvement in the ResNet variants themselves, developed over many papers, already has a component of optimizing the architecture to reduce parameters and/or computational load.

> Since this model is directly related to the Inception module due to use of shorter and longer paths without shortcuts.

This statement is incorrect.  Our model is not directly related to Inception.  It reproduces some local connectivity reminiscent of Inception modules, but the global connectivity structure is entirely different. Even locally, FractalNet has a recursive join structure which Inception modules lack.  As consequence of this is that at global scale, FractalNet contains many paths whose length range over many orders of magnitude (all powers of 2 up to the maximum depth).  In contrast, the shortest path through an Inception network grows linearly with depth (number of modules stacked).

> As an aside, note that Inception networks have already shown that residual networks are not necessary to obtain the best performance

ImageNet performance is a useful benchmark tool, not the end goal of network design.  Mass adoption of ResNet by the community suggests that simplicity and scalability are also legitimate concerns.  With regard to scalability in depth, the only networks previously demonstrated to easily extend to the 100-1000 layer regime rely on some form of residual connection (ResNet/Highway Networks).  We demonstrate a 160-layer FractalNet, placing it in this group.

Moreover, FractalNet and ResNet/Highway all have a mechanism for evolving from being effectively shallow to effectively deep over the course of training. This shallow to deep evolution seems critical, but unfortunately the design of Inception prevents its effective depth from being less than the number of stacked Inception modules.

> It should be noted that Residual/Highway architectures do have a type of anytime property, as shown by lesioning experiments in Srivastava et al and Viet et al.

We disagree.  The lesioning experiments in Veit et al. demonstrate the opposite: ResNet does not have an anytime property.  If deleting a few layers, then yes, ResNet can recover.  However, Section 4.2 and Figure 5 of Veit et al, show that deleting 10 blocks of a 54 block ResNet increases CIFAR-10 error to 0.2, deleting 20 blocks pushes error above 0.5.  So one cannot maintain a reasonable error if halving the ResNet depth.  Compare this to our Table 4: subnetwork columns of one half (20) and even one fourth (10) the layers of a full FractalNet (40) maintain low error on CIFAR-100.  This robustness across many orders of magnitude in depth (and thus time) is required for a useful anytime property and is unique to FractalNet (with drop-path training).

> The architecture specific drop-path regularization is interesting, but is used along with other regularizers such as dropout, batch norm and weight decay and its benefit on its own is not clear.

Drop-path is essential for and the only effective means of enabling anytime output.  The fact that it can contribute as a regularizer in other scenarios is a bonus.

> the experimental evaluation is not convincing, e.g. no improvement on SVHN

As we replied to AnonReviewer1: Section 4.2 observes ""most methods perform similarly on SVHN"".  The errors rates on SVHN are so low as to be uninformative.  We believe SVHN is simply too easy of a dataset to be a challenge to any of the modern techniques in Table 1.  Much like MNIST, SVHN is now a useful sanity check, but not a differentiator.

> number of parameters should be mentioned for all models for fair comparison

We can add this to the table, but please see our larger discussion of experiments above.

> the effect of drop-path seems to vanish with data augmentation

Drop-path is essential for and the only effective means of enabling anytime output.  The fact that it can contribute as a regularizer in the absence of data augmentation is a bonus.

base,gpt-4o,"The paper presents a novel approach to learning representations in deep neural networks using an information-theoretic framework, specifically the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. The authors propose a variational inference method to approximate the IB objective, which they call the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB). This approach aims to create representations that are maximally informative about the target variable while being minimally informative about the input data, thus balancing expressiveness and compression.

### Strengths

1. **Innovative Approach**: The paper introduces a novel method, VIB, which leverages variational inference to approximate the IB objective. This is a significant contribution as it allows the application of the IB principle to deep neural networks, overcoming previous computational challenges.

2. **Theoretical Foundation**: The paper is grounded in solid theoretical concepts from information theory, such as mutual information and the data processing inequality. The use of the reparameterization trick and Monte Carlo sampling to estimate gradients is well-founded and aligns with current best practices in variational inference.

3. **Robustness to Overfitting and Adversarial Attacks**: The authors claim that models trained with VIB are more robust to overfitting and adversarial inputs compared to traditional deterministic models. This is an important advantage in practical applications where model reliability is crucial.

4. **Comparison with Related Work**: The paper provides a comprehensive review of related work, situating the VIB method within the broader context of information-theoretic approaches to deep learning. This helps clarify the novelty and potential impact of the proposed method.

### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Experimental Results**: While the paper mentions a series of experiments, the provided text does not include any specific results or details about these experiments. This makes it difficult to assess the empirical performance and practical applicability of the VIB method.

2. **Complexity and Accessibility**: The paper is dense with theoretical concepts and mathematical formulations, which might be challenging for readers not well-versed in information theory or variational inference. A more intuitive explanation or visualizations could help make the content more accessible.

3. **Assumptions and Limitations**: The paper assumes a specific factorization of the joint distribution and a Markov chain structure, which may not hold in all practical scenarios. The implications of these assumptions on the generalizability of the method are not thoroughly discussed.

4. **Comparison with Other Methods**: Although the paper mentions related methods, it lacks a detailed comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art techniques in"
base,gpt-4o,"### Review of the Paper

#### Strengths

1. **Novel Approach**: The paper introduces a novel hierarchical architecture for neural machine translation (NMT) that leverages character-level information to address the limitations of word-level models. This approach is innovative and attempts to tackle the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem effectively.

2. **Comprehensive Background**: The introduction provides a thorough overview of the existing challenges in NMT, particularly the issues related to vocabulary size and OOV words. It also discusses previous approaches and their limitations, setting a clear context for the proposed solution.

3. **Hierarchical Model**: The proposed model's hierarchical structure, which includes character, subword, and word levels, is well-conceived. This structure aims to capture morphological information and improve translation quality without relying on a large vocabulary.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**: The paper addresses computational efficiency by proposing a model that maintains a similar encoding length to word-based models while eliminating the need for a large vocabulary. This is a significant advantage in terms of memory and computational resource requirements.

5. **Empirical Validation**: The paper claims that the proposed model achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models on several translation tasks (En-Fr, En-Cs, Cs-En), which suggests that the approach is effective in practice.

#### Weaknesses

1. **Lack of Detailed Experiments**: While the paper mentions that the model achieves high translation performance, it lacks detailed experimental results, such as quantitative metrics (e.g., BLEU scores) and comparisons with baseline models. This makes it difficult to assess the true effectiveness of the proposed approach.

2. **Insufficient Theoretical Explanation**: The paper introduces a novel architecture but does not provide a deep theoretical explanation or analysis of why this architecture should work better than existing models. More insights into the model's design choices and their implications would strengthen the paper.

3. **Complexity and Training Challenges**: The proposed model involves multiple recurrent networks, which could lead to increased complexity and potential difficulties in training. The paper does not address how these challenges are mitigated or provide insights into the training process.

4. **Limited Discussion on Limitations**: The paper does not discuss the potential limitations or drawbacks of the proposed approach, such as the increased computational cost due to the hierarchical structure or the challenges in training deep RNNs.

5. **Clarity and Organization**: The paper could benefit from improved clarity and organization. Some sections, particularly the description of the model architecture, are dense"
